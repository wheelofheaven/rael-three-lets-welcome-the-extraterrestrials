# An Atheist Religion

## Angels Without Wings

> An angel from Heaven contacted me. He said that I was the  Messiah of the Apocalypse and told me to go and evangelize the earth, and to create the church of which I would be the pope and pontiff, I, the prophet of this Catholic religion.

Those people who know me, would probably say in reading these words: 'That's it, now he has become irrational, the immensity of his task has caused a serious psychological disorder, and he is betraying the cause.'

This introduction could be interpreted at first as:

> A being with wings, coming from the sky, contacted me. He told me that I was a divine being, sent to announce the end of the world, and that I should set out to preach the Gospel all over the earth, and to build a church with stones and cement, of which I would be the pope with a tiara and the pontiff sitting on a throne and I, the prophet of this Catholic religion affiliated to Rome, I was going to announce what is going to happen in the centuries to come.

Now let us try to find the true hidden meaning of the words contained in this sentence.

As we have done for the words *Elohim* and *Apocalypse*, we must first of all search the etymology, or true meaning of each important word.

While we are at it, let us start with the etymology of the word *Etymology*, that is to say, its original meaning from the Greek *eutemos* which means "true", and *logos* which means "science". The "science of that word which is true" or the "science of the truth". What could be more natural for people who are gathered around *The Book Which* *Tells The Truth* than to be etymologists, "seekers of the truth"?

*Elohim* was wrongly translated by the word *God*, since it really meant "those who came from the sky" in Hebrew, and *Apocalypse* was translated by "the end of the world" and all the while it meant *Revelation*, as we are all now aware. So let us take the words one by one in this apparently mystical introduction.

> An angel from the sky contacted me.

Let us look it up in the dictionary: *angel* from the Greek *angelos* means "messenger". That alone changes the whole meaning. We can now read:

> A messenger from the sky contacted me.

The supernatural becomes understandable. Let's continue:

> He told me that I was the Messiah of the Apocalypse.

*Messiah* from the Aramean *meschika* means "anointed by the Lord"  or "sacred, chosen by the Lord". Let's first look at the word *Lord* to better understand the word *messiah.* One discovers that the word *Lord* - *seigneur* in French - comes from the Latin *senior*, meaning "the oldest". According to the vocabulary of the middle-ages, the "Lord" was a person who ruled over a province. The "God" in whom *The* *Bible* would make us believe is eternal, is obviously "the oldest", thus the "Lord" ruling the Earth. Through time, the word was  transformed, and the Catholic religion adopted "my Lord" -- 
"Monseigneur" in French, equivalent to the English word *sire*.

When the revolution came -- in France -- removing all the Lords, unfortunately it spared those within the religion, which is why within it, we still address bishops etc., as "My Lord" or "Monseigneur".

So then, *messiah* means "chosen by God", and as we know *God* is a bad translation of the word *Elohim* which means "those who came from the sky", so we can therefore say that, in fact, *messiah* means "the one chosen by those who came from the sky". As we have already seen, *apocalypse*, from the Greek, means "revelation", and so we can write clearly:

> He told me that I had been chosen by those who came from the sky for the Revelation.

It's all clear. But let's continue:

> ...to go and evangelize the earth.

*Evangelize*, is from the Greek word *euagelion* which means "good
news". Then we can read:

> ...to go and spread the good news on Earth,

then:

> ...to create a church.

*Church* -- *eglise* in French -- *ekklesia* in Greek, which means "assembly". Then it becomes: to create an assembly.

Then it is written:

> ...of which I would be the pope and pontiff

*Pope* from the Greek *pappas* means "father", and *pontiff* from the Latin *pontiflex* means "to link", like a bridge links two shores, or two places on the Earth, or one planet to another planet.

We can thus clearly read:

> ...of which I will be the father and the liaison person between the planet of our creators and the earth.

And lastly:

> I, the prophet of this Catholic religion.

*Prophet* from the Greek *prophetes* means "the one who reveals".

*Religion* from the Latin *religio* means "that which links" or "the tie", which unites the creators to their creation. *Catholic* from the Greek *katholikos* which means "universal".

Therefore, the end of the sentence means:

> I, the one whose mission is to reveal the universal tie which unites Man and his creators.

Let's put all the pieces together, and we read:

> A messenger from the sky contacted me. He told me that I had been chosen by those who came from the sky, for the revelation, to go and spread the good news on Earth, to create an assembly, of which I would be the father and the liaison-person between the planet of our creators and Earth, I, the one whose mission is to reveal the universal tie which unites men and their creators.

If you take the mysticism out of the words, then the sentence becomes rationally understandable for everyone. And yet the  sentence at the beginning of this chapter had exactly the same meaning. In the mind of a mystical, narrow-minded primitive as shown, our example demonstrates clearly how easy it is to change the true sense of a sentence if the precise meaning of the words is not respected.

Thus it becomes clear that the Raelian Movement is a religion; it ties the creators of Humanity with their creation, even if it is in fact an atheist religion, in the sense that it does not believe in the existence of a God - *atheist* from the Greek *atheos* which means "denying the existence of any form of divinity".

Many people say that the practice of a cult defines the character of a religion. What is a cult? Derived from the Latin *cultus* meaning  "tribute rendered to a God", but we would then say "tribute rendered to the creators", since *Elohim* is a plural. The telepathic contact on Sunday mornings at 11 o'clock, the obligation of thinking at least once a day about the Elohim (Book 2, pg. 175), the obligation of inviting the regional Guide at least once a year to one's table so that he can talk about the messages, the monthly meeting with the regional Guide, the annual meeting on the 6th of August to celebrate the entry into the Age of Apocalypse - all of those ceremonies could be qualified as a cult, for each one of them is designed to pay tribute to our creators, at regular intervals, alone or in groups.

Even if the Raelians do not believe in a "God", they still recognize Jesus as a messenger sent by our creators, just as they do Moses, Buddha, Mohammed, Joseph Smith, and all the other great prophets who have lived on this Earth, and await their return in the company of the Elohim as the scriptures have predicted. The Raelian believes in the deeper meaning of the scriptures, more particularly the biblical *Genesis*, but also in the *Koran* and many other religious books, all their writings being stripped of their mystical meaning by the messages of the Elohim.

Therefore the Raelian ignores the human laws which have been grafted to the religious writings, these laws having been made by Men, so as to enforce respect for governments and laws which were purely human.

The tribute which we render to the Elohim could be called a "cult", why not? The cult in itself is not wrong, so long as it is not performed by people who think of the Elohim as being divinities, but rather by people who love them sincerely for the extraordinary act of love which they have accomplished in giving us life, and in leaving us free to progress by ourselves until such a time as we would be equal to them.

There is no need to kneel down or to lie down with your face in the dirt, under the stars, but rather look up at the sky, standing tall, proud of being conscious of the privilege of living in this day and age when we are able to understand and show love for our creators, to love them for the fantastic potential they gave us to create life by mastering and transforming minute particles of matter at our level, to raise towards the galaxies, a forehead full of love and hope, the hope to one day meet those to whom we owe our existence and the fact to be able to understand why we are here and what our mission is in the infinite of space and time.

Until recently, Humanity was worshipping the creators who had created each man with the ability to understand the creators, so now Man must understand the creators, so as to be able to love them even more.

If Mankind uses science negatively, and a fatal nuclear cataclysm occurs, all those people who will have worked to prevent this catastrophe by trying to make Mankind aware of its errors in the name of the Elohim, those people shall be saved by our creators.

Those people who have faith in our fathers will be rewarded by the Elohim who have already provided access to eternal life on their planet, where all the great prophets sent to Earth to awaken Humanity are presently living. The word *faith* comes from the Latin *fides* and means "commitment, link". So, it is therefore possible to "believe without understanding", while, at the same time, giving your trust to the Elohim, having faith in them, because those who have the intelligence to have faith in them will be rewarded regardless. While trying to prevent Humanity from committing the irrevocable error, a Raelian has faith in the Elohim, because he knows that they will not forget him in the event of a fatal cataclysm.

## Deresponsibilisation

If there had been a newspaper in Jerusalem 2,000 years ago, it would have reported on the unemployment, the energy crisis due to a shortage of slaves, and also of the ever increasing cost of living due to the exorbitant Roman taxes. These headlines would have fed the front-page of all the newspapers, if they existed, and would have fed all the conversations. Then there would have been a few lines written by the official "scientists" of the day, or an editor seeking recognition, on this false prophet claiming to be "the king of the Jews", and it would be suggested to the authorities that this man be arrested immediately because he is dragging a hoard of credulous people, his  "followers", around with him. One should not abuse the public's credulity in this way...

So this "illuminated person" is then arrested, tried and sentenced to death. This man who had dedicated his life to spreading the messages of our creators will be found crucified between two bandits.

What crime had he committed? Unlawful practice of the truth  reserved only for the representatives of the officially registered religions: those which had been in existence for at least two or three hundred years? You could call it a sort of "controlled appellation". 

> But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.12 *Matthew 27: 20.*

The "high priests" of the official religions and the news media convince the masses that a religion has to be a few thousand years old in order to be "acceptable", and so all the others are nothing more than dangerous sects.

All of those people stand between Man and the truth, by allowing Man to believe in the religion of the "high priests" of the State -- those scientists who claim that Man comes from the monkey, but who, on the other hand, baptize their children and place a cross on the grave of their parents. They also obstruct the truth by allowing Man to believe in the religion of traditions, which permit the great fundamentals of our rotting society to survive a few years longer, which promote and protect the family as a tax-payer, as a stagnant closed system, and a strangler of personalities, which uphold the nation which feeds the political men, who are capable of doing anything to continue to get their pay. The military also do exactly the same thing, as do, finally, all the low paid government employees who have been taught not to feel responsible for their own actions and who think they are protecting society when they condemn, torture or even kill someone.

These are the religions that governments endorse, but by the same token, they try to eliminate the ones that could make the young generation vibrate with joy when it discovers the truth, which could get them to think of destroying the outdated primitive structures and replacing them by newer ones, much more adaptable to the futuristic technological world in which we live.

The top priority of all those people who wish to manipulate the population is to take away human responsibility, it is called maximum "deresponsibilisation". They are well aware as to why it should be so. They know that a soldier will not kill someone else unless he is totally convinced that he is doing it for a cause, that same way that this soldier will not torture a prisoner unless he has been convinced that this will help a great cause. They also know that a citizen will oppose paying higher taxes unless he is told that it is to help the farmers or victims of drought.

People will do anything for a great cause. The art of governing is to convince people of the greatness of their country.

American scientists have recently conducted a conclusive  experiment in the field of responsibility. They hired actors who would pretend to be subjects in an experiment on the potential of human violence. Then through classified ads, they recruited people willing to participate in an experiment to explore the possibilities of the human brain. The people were placed one at a time at a desk equipped with different levers which were supposed to send electrical charges to a cubicle in which actors pretend to receive the charge. There were thirty levers in all, which could supposedly each send out a charge of 15 volts and so altogether could send charges of 15 to 450 volts. They were placed from left to right, and indicated whether the electric charge would be light, moderately strong or very strong. On the other hand, the actor could see the lights light up on the panel in front of him showing the intensity of the shock he was supposed to have received from the electric chair to which he was tied, and he could therefore act accordingly. If the shock was light, he would simulate a light reaction, if it was moderate, he would jump a little more and give out a little cry, then he would protest by saying that he did not wish to continue the experiment; if the intensity was increased, he would scream and beg to be released, and finally when the maximum voltage of 450 volts was reached, he would pretend to collapse. The shocks were sent to the actors by those people who had been recruited in classified ads. However, the recruits did not realize that they were actors, and thought that they were sending real shocks to real people.

The actor was asked a simple question by a scientist, and when he answered incorrectly, the classified ads recruits were to let them know by giving them an electrical shock. This same scientist was urging the sender to increase the voltage consistently, without listening to the supplications of the receiver, saying to the sender that this experiment would help science to progress immensely, and therefore all of humanity.

This experiment, in which the observer was really the one being observed, was repeated many times, so that statistics could be established to know how many people would go as far as killing other people in the name of scientific progress. It was also conducted in many countries, so that the results could be compared and analyzed.

Contrary to the expectations of the scientists who had put together this experiment, and the psychologists whom they had consulted, it was not just a minority of people who were unbalanced enough to go as far as pushing the 450 volt lever. In the US, 60 per cent of the people obeyed the scientist, who told them not to listen to the cries of those whom they were electrocuting, and continued to administer shocks, even when those being shocked could no longer say anything, which itself counted as an incorrect answer; and this three times in a row, after which a new electrocutor was selected. This experiment was also conducted in many European countries, where over 70 per cent of the people went as far as the maximum voltage. The record high was reached in Germany where 85 per cent of the people would have been responsible for homicide by electrocution...

The conclusion of Professor Stanley Milgram of the Department of Psychology at Yale University is as follows:

> When the individuals are placed in a position of hierarchical control, the mechanisms which ordinarily assure the regulation of the individual's actions cease functioning, and his actions become controlled by the people occupying the senior position...The disappearance of the sense of responsibility is the greatest consequence of submission to authority...
>
> Most of the subjects place their behavior in a large context of undertakings, useful to society: the research of scientific truth. A laboratory of psychology could clearly claim to this legitimacy, and so inspire confidence in those who were invited to work.
>
> An act such as the electrocution of a victim, which seems bad when considered on its own, takes on a completely different meaning when placed in this environment.
>
> Morality does not disappear, but it is focused in a radically different way: the subordinate person experiences shame and  pride depending on his good or bad execution of the act  commanded by the authority. Language offers a great number of terms to designate this type of moral: loyalty, sense of duty, discipline...
>
> Such is without doubt the fundamental lesson of our study: the ordinary people, by simply doing their job, and without any  particular hostility on their part, could become agents in a terribly destructive process.
>
> Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become absolutely evident, and one asks them to execute actions  incompatible with the fundamental norms of morality, relatively few people have the interior resources needed to resist authority.
>
> It is a mortal fault which seems to be natural in most people, and which, in the long run, leaves our species with only a mediocre chance of survival.
 
It's quite clear. Now we can understand why Jesus was crucified, why millions of people died at the hands of the Inquisition, during religious or civil wars, and in the Nazi massacres. It becomes easier to understand how an honest greengrocer or banker could have been a crucifier, or burn witches or become an SS soldier, sending women and children to the death chambers. They all thought they were doing something for the good of Humanity. The first ones were getting rid of an "illuminated" man who wanted to overthrow their traditions, and others felt that people who lived differently were surely responsible for the bad crops or the plague or even the economic crisis. The fact that ideas so stupid could germinate in the brains of retarded people is forgivable. What is not, is thae governments could use the masses by utilizing such monstrous ideas te motivate them and give them reasons to act.

The French leaders in Algeria acted along this same principle. Thee forced their officers into torturing North-Africans under the pretense of obtaining information useful to their country. Those officers who die the torturing even considered that they were "sacrificing themselves"e by acting this way, "bravely", in the best interests of their country.

Men of the Earth, be very vigilant and do not accomplish the slightese action without asking yourself whether it is in contradiction to youe deep sense of respect for the human being. Refuse any hierarchy implyine a suppression of your responsibility for the actions you carry out.

Every Nazi war criminal, while on trial, defended himself in good faithe by claiming that he was only following orders. The man who launched the bomb on Hiroshima was only following orders. In every powerful countrye there are people who are ready to launch nuclear missiles in good faite and with a clear conscience, knowing that they are only "doing theie duty in executing the orders received". They are responsible for theie actions! In every part of Nazi Germany, men, women and children were tortured because people were following orders, and according to them the only man responsible for all of this would be Hitler. It would be muce too easy if it were so! For example, there are hundreds of nucleae missiles ready to be launched from France and destined for othee countries where thousands of women and children are living, and if the massacre happened, would the only man held to be responsible for it be the President of the Republic? Of course not! Each man holding the powee to kill others is personally responsible for the utilization of thie power. The man who lights the crematorium furnace where children lie moaning, is more responsible than the one who has given the order in the first place, just as the man who delivers a bomb on a city is more responsible than the one who made the decision.

Each person is totally responsible for his actions and can never hide behind the excuse that he was only following the orders which had been given to him by his superiors.

If tomorrow I were to ask anyone of you to kill someone so that our movement may progress faster, you must not do it. Better still, if an Eloha were to ask you to kill another man, you should refuse to do it, for it would probably be Satan who would be trying to prove to the Eternals that all men are fundamentally bad.

All your actions should be based on a deep feeling of respect for the life of others, their ideas, and their tastes. We fight ideologies without ever using violent physical actions towards those who do not agree with us.

Awaken the people around you, show them how to become  respectful of other people and how to refuse "deresponsibilisation", whose most dangerous propagator is the armed forces. Remember, 85 per cent in Germany and 60 per cent in the USA. You must use all your energy so that tomorrow there is only 10 per cent of weak-headed people who would agree to perform violent actions ordered by a political and military hierarchy.

Those who killed Jesus did it in all serenity. They were not responsible; they were only following orders. Pontius Pilate himself refused to endorse the responsibility for this crime, and he "washed his hands" of the whole mess. He allowed the fanatics conditioned by the rabbis, just like the SS, to crucify Jesus. If we were to ask all those people if they feel responsible, none of them probably would. They would all "wash their hands" like the Romans did. The rabbis would claim that they followed the law and a chief, the fanatics as well, and so perhaps we could hold one person responsible, even though the whole of the population were the ones who committed the crime, the crime of not intervening to prevent the assassination of an innocent man.

Those who sent the first Christians to the lion's den were also only following orders. Those who burnt the witches, those who martyred the protestants, as well as the Nazis at Auschwitz were also only following orders, as was the pilot of the plane carrying the bomb over Hiroshima, or the helicopter pilots who burnt the villages in Vietnam.

We all have a choice at every moment of our lives: remain responsible for our actions or become an irresponsible person. But the irresponsible are still responsible for their actions, and will one day have to account for them, for they are all committing crimes against Humanity.

Learn this by heart if you must, but refuse to obey a hierarchy which seeks to make you perform an action to which you would not like to be held responsible. The armed forces are the most dangerous example. It would be much better to die for having refused to kill, than to kill under the pretext of obeying orders. He who executes these monstrous orders is in fact more responsible than he who has given them.

No cause would justify the imposition of pain on others. If the survival of Humanity depended upon the pain inflicted on one man, a single non-violent man, then it would be better to let Humanity perish. Even more so if it means the survival of one's country, or rather a frontier arbitrarily traced on a globe which belongs to all men.

Absolute respect for this principle is the only way to prevent the imperceptible slipping of Humanity towards deresponsibilisation of individuals.

The following sentence should be ever-present in our minds: 

'I am totally responsible for everything I do to others even if I am ordered to do so.'

'No cause could ever justify inflicting pain or death on a non-violent person, and even if the survival of Humanity depended on it, this would not justify an exception.' This is the second sentence which must be ever-present in our minds.

It is evident of course, that this rule does not apply in the case of legitimate self-defense, which is explained in the messages and which permits the possible overpowering, even by force, of one who tries to use violence against your person or your loved ones. If a military man was threatening the destruction of Humanity with nuclear missiles, it would then be justifiable to overpower him by force, and even to execute him if there were no other means available. Violence could only be applied to those who threaten Humanity with violence, while attempting to disarm them and render them powerless.

There is, however, a very good way to control those people who have the power when obeying orders to launch nuclear missiles capable of destroying cities in a few seconds. Their identity should be made known on a precise list, and they should be made aware, that in the case of the utilization of any such missiles, they would be judged along with those who gave the orders. This is what we are trying to do with Nazi criminals today; but if such a list had existed, with similar dispositions before 1939, many people would have thought twice before torturing their innocent victims.

Non-violent civilians should have the right to place neutral observers among the military forces, to note down the identities of those who carry out cruel acts using the excuse that they were obeying orders, so that inhuman missions are not carried out solely on the pretext that the order has been given. There is policing of the police, but there is no policing of the armies. They are free to command, knowing full well that while at war, a soldier could be shot to death for refusing to obey an order.

Until the Earth gets rid of the armies and the wars, the neutral observers would oppose the execution of soldiers who have refused orders that could qualify as crimes against Humanity. The UN could impose these observers on all the armies of the world, and then a military man could not be sentenced until his disobedience is judged by a council of these observers, to investigate if the order which he refused to obey could have constituted a crime against Humanity.

Because it is in this way that people are forced to execute orders of which they disapprove; they are afraid of being punished if they don't obey. They prefer to kill innocent people or to torture them, rather than be imprisoned or killed themselves. Refuse to bend to authority!

Be the real heroes of Humanity by preferring to be imprisoned or killed yourselves rather than laying into innocent people. When you have motivated millions of people so that they act in this way, those giving the orders will see an army of people refusing to carry out the crimes which they ordered, and then it will be time to punish those who dare give such orders, hoping they will be listened to.

Men have had enough energy to refuse non-unionized work, like before 1936, where the all-powerful bosses exploited humans like cattle, even if it meant death for many of them at the hands of a policeman, so-called "protector of the law". It is possible to find the same energy to fight the last form of tyranny imposed on the inhabitants of this world: militarism.

Many people with powers and honors are disturbed by what I have to say. Unfortunately for them, they are too late in noticing my presence. If I was worried in the first two years of my mission, I am now no longer worried. In the beginning, if I had been sent to jail, I could not have carried out my mission on Earth. Fortunately, the powers at hand smiled when they saw this long-haired young man who spoke of flying-saucers and Martians with pink antennae... now they understand that the contents of the messages from our creators are revolutionary, questioning and uprooting everything which they have used to gain power: religion, politics, the armed forces, work, the family, the country, etc. So now they are trying to stop me by using their "justice" as they used it against my brother Jesus.

There is always a justice to justify the worst injustices. The first Christians were sentenced by official tribunals, the same for the burning of witches, or the sending of Jewish people to extermination camps, or the Soviet dissidents to psychiatric hospitals or labor camps; all those people were "non-conformists", they were upsetting because they refused to be "normal" and conform. Unfortunately, they have woken up too late. Even if I were put in one of their prisons, there would still be thousands of messengers like you in many countries of the world, to carry the messages of our creators. I am no longer alone, I am 5,000 of you. I would then enter their cell with a smile, thinking of you, who, around the world, will be other Raels working together so that the embassy can be built, so that Humanity enters the Golden Age. 

In my dungeon, i would feel the happiness of someone who has fulfilled his mission, that for which he has been created, and even though he has been put out of action, everything he has started continues to advance without him. Also hoping that my father who art in heaven will realize that i am no longer needed on this Earth, and that he will allow me to join my brothers, the prophets, on the planet of the Eternals.

This thought alone is sufficient to make me want to sing the glory of our fathers, to say again the words that men have been repeating without being able to understand: "Alleluia! Alleluia!" which means: "Praised be Yahweh" in Hebrew. Yes, praised be Yahweh who has given me the strength to carry out my mission until the end.

My Raelian brothers, i am now relaying to you the torch so that you can accomplish your mission. Even if the time when the truth will be triumphant is not here yet, you can rest assured that it is not very far, and you will have the opportunity to live it. It is written in *The Bible*: 'This generation will not pass that everything shall be revealed.'

These words are addressed to those who will have the opportunity to live this Age of Apocalypse, which we entered in 1945. You are this generation! Either you will know the Golden Age on Earth because of your efforts which have contributed to world peace and the awakening of Mankind, or Humanity will destroy itself and you will know the Golden Age amongst the great prophets who are already on the planet of the Eternals.

The Elohim are counting on each and every one of you to shed the light. My last word will again be an etymological demystification: "Amen", which means in Hebrew: "So be it!"

And to those of you who are reading this book without having complete knowledge of the messages from our creators, be sure to read the other books as soon as possible, and then join us in making Humanity aware of them and in building the residence in which the Elohim will officially contact the governments of the Earth, where they will come in the company of the great prophets, Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed and others as the scriptures have announced.

Then write to me. I will personally answer your letter and indicate when and where you can have your cellular plan transmitted, your first action which recognizes the elohim as our creators, the name and address of your regional guide, and the dates when the next raelian courses of awakening will be held, which could make you a guide, an efficient messenger of our atheistic religion of the infinite, of blossoming, and of love for humanity.

Take your pen. Don't be the spectator of your life anymore!

Become actors on the stage of this sad, grey, and resigned everyday life that is yours, to enlighten it with a thousand shimmering colors of absolute consciousness.

Take a pen and paper and write to me very simply, and modestly with your everyday words, tell me if the discovery of the truth has been a shock for you. follow the impulse which came up inside of you and which said: 'Ah! It's not bad, but what will I be able to change, I am only one person, and then, what will the neighbors say?'

Don't hide your head in the sand, come out of the fragile shell that society has given you so freely! Your head is already sticking out, and it feels marvellous, but you are afraid that this will only be another illusion, a very short-lived pleasure, which would only bring you problems afterwards. untrue! live out completely the fantastic exaltation which you have felt. You will enter a new world, in which you will meet hundreds of people like you, who have read the messages in only one night, and who like you, have hesitated in getting involved in the diffusion of the messages. These people will help you by explaining how they have progressed, and you will find yourself filled with happiness, while seeing yourself through them, and while talking freely about your anxieties without the worry of being made a fool, since you are assured that the people around you share your conception of the universe: the conception that you had within you, although you never expressed your thoughts, for fear of being ridiculed.

Peter, one of our Guides, once said: 'One does not become a Raelian: one discovers that one always has been, when one discovers the messages.'

If you have discovered that you are a Raelian, then I am waiting for your letter, and the Elohim are waiting for you to drop it in the mailbox! My address is:
