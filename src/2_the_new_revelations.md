# The New Revelations

This chapter contains revelations that the Elohim had asked Rael to keep secret until three years after his journey when the second message was revealed to him. Now that we are in the year 34 (1979), these things can be known to all.

## The Devil Does Not Exist, I Met Him

Do not tremble when wondering if a creature with horns, with cloven feet, well hidden, waits for the right moment to come and prick your backside with a trident. Since there is no “God” sitting on a white cloud, holding a flash of lightning in his right hand, the devil does not exist either.

For the average person, Devil, Satan, Lucifer or Demon are different names attributed to a single person who is one and the same, and personifies the forces of evil, just as they would think of “Apocalypse” as meaning “the end of the world”.

Let us trace the true meaning of these words. Satan is chronologically the most ancient. When the Elohim created the first completely synthetic living beings in the laboratories on their original planet, a certain group of people from their world protested against these genetic manipulations, which they thought were dangerous for their civilization. They were afraid that one day the scientists would create monsters that would escape from the laboratories and would commit murders within the population. Unfortunately, we know that this is what happened, and the movement that was trying to have this genetic engineering work forbidden, triumphed. So the government of the planet of the Elohim ordered the scientists to halt their experiments and forced them to destroy all their works.

The group which led the battle against these genetic manipulations was presided by an Eloha called Satan.

The scientists were finally permitted to go to another planet and pursue their experiments. A description of this event is described in Matthew 13:3-4. It is a parable which describes the works of the creation of life on other planets by the Elohim:

> A sower went forth to sow; and when he sowed, some seeds fell by the
way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up.

The birds are the messengers sent by Satan, who thought that the planet chosen for their creation of life experiments was far too close to their own, and that if by chance the beings created in a laboratory were in fact more intelligent than their creators, and became violent, they could prove to be dangerous for the population of the Elohim’s planet. The government gave them permission to once again destroy the works of the scientists.

They had to search for another planet which lent itself to the creation of life, but they failed twice. The first time, the chosen planet was too close to a star, and the creation was burnt by the harmful rays coming from that star, and on the second one, they were invaded by the vegetation. Finally, they reached a planet which offered all the necessary elements so that their creation could survive, and it was located far enough away so as not to show any signs of danger in the eyes of the association presided over by Satan.

> Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: but other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
>
> Matthew 13: 5-9.

We know the Elohim also created life on two other planets at that time, hence the allusion to “three harvests”.

We also know that the permission which allowed the scientists to come to Earth to create life was granted to them on the sole condition that they did not create people in their image. The first message explains how they overruled this order and also shows the reaction of their government, which strictly forbade them to reveal to the first terrestrial men, whom they had fabricated, how they had been created and who they were, and demanded that these first men be obligated to fear their creators, by asking the creators to show themselves as supernatural beings, divine beings in some way.

Satan thought that one could not expect anything good from these scientifically created creatures, and that out of Man only evil could come.

So we understand perfectly that Satan was just one of the Elohim, leading, in some way, a political party on the planet, that was opposed to the creation of artificial beings in their image by other Elohim who themselves thought that they could create positive and non-violent beings.

Then came Lucifer, which means “light bearer”. Lucifer is one of the Elohim who created life on Earth, thus created Man.

Lucifer was heading a small group of scientists working in one of the genetic engineering laboratories which studied the behavior of the first ynthetic men. Noticing the extraordinary aptitudes exhibited by their creation, Lucifer decided to overrule the order and reveal to these first humans that those whom they had mistaken for “Gods” where in fact men like themselves, made of flesh and blood, and who came from another planet in flying machines made of palpable material. Lucifer, and the Elohim who followed him, felt love and affection for their synthetically created humans. They started to love these beings as their own children - these beings that they studied all day long, who were obliged to look upon them as "Gods". 

They could not bear to see their creatures, who seemed to be a physical and psychological success, and who were beautiful and intelligent, on their hands and knees adoring them as if they were idols, all of this just because the government of their planet of origin, of which Yahweh was the president, strictly forbade them from telling their creations the truth and forced the Elohim to play the role of supernatural beings permanently.

Lucifer, "the bearer of light", enlightened the first men when he revealed that the creators were not "Gods" but men like themselves.

This attitude is directly opposed to that of Satan who thinks that only evil can be expected from men, and also to Yahweh, the president of the council of the Eternals governing the Elohim's planet.

So far, no creature with horns.

Yahweh condemns the scientists who had disobeyed his orders to spend the rest of their lives in exile on Earth. He condemns the  "serpent" to crawl on Earth, as it is so poetically written, and evicts Man from the laboratory, the "Garden of Eden" where they were fed and lodged without having to make the slightest effort.

But Satan doesn't give up over this, as what he wishes is that all the beings that have been created, be totally destroyed, because he judges them to be dangerous, due to their violence. As time passes, Satan accumulates proof of Man's aggression by observing the way in which humans kill each other with the weapons that are given to them by the sons of Lucifer's exiled group of Elohim. The latter is involved in

"tender" relations with the daughters of men who manage to receive weapons in exchange for their charms, under the false pretense of giving them to their fathers or brothers so that they can hunt for food. In fact, men choose to fight abominable battles among themselves with this arsenal.

Seeing the proofs of such a slaughter, brought by Satan before the Council of the Eternals, Yahweh decides to do what Satan asks, that is to say, totally destroy the life that has been created on Earth, and by the same token allow Lucifer's group to return to their own planet and be forgiven, thus putting an end to their exile.

But when Lucifer's group learns that their fabulous creation is soon to be destroyed, they decide that they cannot allow that. They still feel very strongly that among men there are some who are positive and non-violent, full of love and fraternity. Among these was Noah whom they helped build a space craft which would protect him from destruction, by staying in orbit around the earth. This craft contained a few men and women and the genetic codes of some animal species, which would be used to re-create them after the cataclysm.

It was only then that the Elohim discovered that they too had been created in the same manner that they had created man, scientifically, in a laboratory, by other people coming from another world. They then decided never again to destroy humanity, and helped Lucifer's group to re-implant the life forms preserved in the "ark". Satan is still convinced of the evil in Man, but he bows before the majority of those who, behind Yahweh, think the contrary within the council of the Eternals. Yahweh understood, through the message contained in the unmanned spaceship coming from another planet which landed on their planet, that if men are violent they will "self-destroy" when they discover energies enabling them to enter an interplanetary level of civilization.

The Elohim decided to let men progress by themselves, but chose certain people, or had them born on Earth, who would be responsible for the creation of the religions, which were designed to keep traces of their work on Earth, so that the creators of Man would be recognized as such when the time came when mankind had  sufficiently evolved, scientifically, to be able to understand rationally.

Messages of such importance could be given only to trustworthy people, and first of all, the Elohim had to assure themselves that their chosen ones were faithful to their creators, so that they would not betray what was revealed to them. So Satan was given the responsibility of testing the prophets.

How are they going to test the faithfulness of these people? Once a person has been contacted by the messengers of the Elohim, telling him of his mission, Satan or one of his men would contact the prophet-to-be and by slander would destroy the Elohim in his mind, trying to get the human to abjure his fathers, or to accept to betray his mission on the promise of material advantages, for example. What is the word for slanderer in Greek? Simply *diablos*. Here is our famous devil, but he still has no horns, no hooves...

Jesus, for example, was taken into the desert for forty days for his initiation period, and was at certain times confronted with, "the devil" to see if he would deny his father:

> Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of
the devil.
>
> Matthew 4: 1.

Or, to be clearer:

> 'Jesus was taken to the desert to be tested by a slanderer.'

The many tests imposed by "the devil" are also described. First of all, he asks Jesus to turn the stones into bread to prove he is the son of God:

> 'If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.' But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.'
>
> *Matthew 4: 3-4.*

Jesus tells Satan that it is more important to be faithful to the Elohim than to eat. The devil is tempting him with food since Jesus has fasted for quite some time. Then Jesus is carried to the pinnacle of the temple and told to jump so that the "angels of God" will cushion his fall to prevent him from being injured:

> 'If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and, On their hands they shall bear thee up, lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.' Jesus said unto him, 'Again it is written, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.'
>
> Matthew 4: 6-7.

Jesus replies to the devil that he has not been placed on Earth for the useless exercise of testing his creators, thus proving that he does not ask for their help at every moment.

Then Satan leads Jesus to the top of a high mountain and proposes to make him a great and very rich king on the Earth.

Again, the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; and he said unto him, 'All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.' Then saith Jesus unto him,

> 'Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.' Then the devil leaveth him; and behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
>
> Matthew 4: 8-11.*

Jesus shows his loyalty to the Elohim whom he prefers to serve rather than become a powerful and rich man. It must be noted in these verses that Jesus refers to the slanderer by his name, since he calls him Satan. Since the test was successful, the "angels", the Elohim's messengers, came down to Jesus to complete the initiation.

Jesus was not the only one to be tested by "the devil"; Job was also tested by Satan. The beginning of *The Book of Job* is quite eloquent, as it shows clearly what good relations, or even fraternal relations there were between Yahweh and Satan:

Now there was a day when the sons of Elohim came to present  themselves before Yahweh, and Satan came also among them.

And Yahweh said unto Satan, 'Whence comest thou?' Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, 'From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.' And Yahweh said unto

Satan, 'Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth Elohim, and escheweth evil?' Then Satan answered  Yahweh, and said, 'Doth Job fear Elohim for nought? Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.' And Yahweh said unto Satan, 'Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand.'

> So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh.
>
> Job 1: 6-12.

We can see clearly that Yahweh is above Satan in the Elohim  hierarchy. But still he authorizes Satan, in his capacity of "opposition party leader", to do as he pleases, by giving him Job, so to speak, so that he can prove that he can take a man who loves the Elohim profoundly, and bring him to hate them if he is afflicted by misfortunes, ruin or sickness.

In fact, Satan ruins Job totally, but the latter continues to love and show respect for the Elohim:

> Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, and said, 'Naked came  I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Yahweh gave, and Yahweh hath taken away; blessed be the name of Yahweh.' In all this Job sinned not, nor charged Elohim foolishly.
>
> *Job 1: 20-22.*

But Satan doesn't give up; he reports to the president of the Council of the Eternals:

Again there was a day when the sons of Elohim came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan came also among them to  present himself before Yahweh. And Yahweh said unto Satan,

'From whence comest thou?' And Satan answered Yahweh, and said, 'From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.' And Yahweh said unto Satan, 'Hast thou  considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth Elohim, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.'

And Satan answered Yahweh, and said, 'Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.' And Yahweh said unto Satan, 'Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life..' Job 2: 1-6.

Yahweh therefore allows Satan to ruin Job's health so as to see if he will always love his creators. And Job continues to respect the Elohim.

Only then he began to ask Yahweh why he had been brought into the world, if it was only to be afflicted with all kinds of misfortunes.

Finally, Yahweh intervenes and briefly explains to Job what has happened. Yahweh tells Job that he is wrong to judge his creators who ran the test, and to regret having been born. Yahweh restores Job's health, and even more possessions than he had before he was ruined. 

At the end of the meeting I had with Yahweh on the relay vessel, he stepped out for a few moments, telling me that he would meet with me later. Then one of the other two Elohim asked me to follow him.

He took me to a small room, marvelously decorated. The walls were like the interior of a round pyramid, and those walls were covered with luminous sound waves which gave the impression of multicolored water waves. Everything was moving to a marvelously relaxing rhythm of musical vibrations. After having me seated in a comfortable chair which was covered with black fur, giving it the impression of being alive, he said:

'I must warn you that among the Elohim there is not only one opinion as to the future of Humanity on Earth. Yahweh thinks that men are good, and he feels that we should let them progress by themselves, convinced that if they are negative, they will self-destroy. 

All my many followers and I, think that men are evil and that we should help mankind hasten its self-destruction. We propose that you help us accelerate the final cataclysm, which would only purify the universe of beings who are only the result of an unsuccessful experiment.

If you try to accomplish the mission given to you by Yahweh, you will always remain a poor man, and you will have to put up with the sarcasm of everyone. You will suffer, perhaps even be put in jail, or even worse, put to death by your own blood brothers. If you accept my offer, and carry out my plan based on increasing the various racist tendencies existing in human beings so that a racial world conflict erupts, I will make you very powerful and rich. Your role will consist of publishing the books which I will dictate to you, and which will enable you to create various political and spiritual movements preaching the destruction of the Arab race, the yellow race and the black race, who have taken over all the riches and the raw materials that the white race needs and deserves to have, since it was the efforts of white men which permitted them to develop techniques to search for them and to utilize them in the first place. As soon as this planetary conflict breaks out, you and all those people who have helped you to bring it about, will be saved. We will take you to safety on board one of our crafts, and eventually you will be allowed to return to Earth when everything has been destroyed, so that you can start a new humanity. You will govern this new civilization as you may desire, and with our help of course.

In the meantime, as soon as you return to Earth, there will be a sum of 1 billion, 5 billion, 10 billion, or more if you wish, deposited in the name of a foundation in a Swiss bank account, to help you get started. Tell us what that sum should be, and if it is not sufficient, other deposits will be made immediately.

Furthermore, if you accept to help us, you and all of those people who will have helped you, will have the right to eternal life.

The only thing we ask is that you do so, so that Humanity destroys the horrible civilization that is theirs today. For this, you will also have to tell them that you have met with an extra-terrestrial, and he has warned you of an invasion of the Earth by them. We will give you the necessary proofs of our existence, and no one will doubt your words anymore. In this way, Humanity will increase its armaments to prepare itself against possible attack from the sky. This will prevent Yahweh from another approach attempting to stop men from killing each other, from building up an even greater stock of nuclear weapons and aggression on Earth.

Consider on the one hand, some people are asking you to work for an already lost cause, since sooner or later, men will blow themselves off the face of the Earth. These same people will not even give you proofs of their existence to help you to convince your brothers, nor any financial aid. They will leave you to face the sarcasm, the police and judicial pressures that might lead you to prison, without counting the possibility that some fanatic might kill you because you claim that there is no "God". On the other hand, my proposition makes you a rich and very powerful man immediately, a man who will only have accelerated a course in which humans are already destined.

So, what is your decision? Do you want to think about it for a few days before giving me your answer?'

And I answered: 'I am not at all convinced that Humanity will self-destroy, even though there is a nine out of ten chance that it will.

Even if there was only one chance in a thousand that Humanity suppressed its aggression and escaped destruction, I think that it would be worthwhile taking this one chance. I would like to think that men will understand before it is too late. And even if the final cataclysm occurred, Yahweh told me that all the people who will have fought for peace and non-violence will be saved, in order to repopulate the Earth and try to build a loving world. Your proposition does not offer anything more, except perhaps that in your plan, only those people who will have contributed to the explosion of violence will be saved. The new civilization which they would then structure could not avoid being violent, because of the dominant characteristics of its founders, directly, socially and hereditarily.

The mere fact of telling Humanity of the invasion of Earth by extra-terrestrials would be sufficient to trigger more fear and then increase aggression on our planet. So even if there is only one chance in a thousand that the Earth could be saved at the present time, this chance would be cut in half upon hearing the news of a possible intervention on your part. One of the most important factors which can contribute to lessening violence between men is the awakening of the mind to the universe and to the infinite. If all men looked to the sky with hope and fraternity, then they would feel much closer to each other and would think less about killing each other.

I am not interested in becoming rich and powerful. I have almost nothing, but the little I have is all that I need to live very happily. My mission which I am accomplishing fills my life with happiness. All I need is food for my children and a roof over their heads. All of this has been given to me by faithful disciples who wish to help me bring the truth to all the people of Earth. I cannot live in two houses at the same time, nor can I drive two cars simultaneously, and even if I owned my house, that does not mean that I could sleep any better, nor would the fire be warmer. As for the mission entrusted to me by Yahweh, I would much rather that it be carried out through the collective efforts of those who wish to welcome the Elohim, as this would certainly be the most beautiful proof of love that we can give to our creators.'

'So you are refusing my proposition?' asked the Eloha.

'Yes, and for all the reasons which I have just mentioned, since I am fundamentally opposed to violence.'

'Are you sure you will never regret this?' he asked. 'Would you not rather wait and think about it?'

'I will never change my mind, no matter what happens to me. Even if my life was in danger, I would much rather direct my efforts so that love and fraternity unite all men, so that they welcome their creators, as the Elohim deserve to be welcomed.'

At that moment, the door opened, and Yahweh entered with the other Eloha. He told me, 'I am very pleased with the reaction that you have had to the proposals which were made to you. I was convinced of your reactions, but Satan, our brother, who has just tested you, will not be convinced that something good can be expected of men until they are united, and money and all weapons are destroyed. My second companion who is so happy with your behavior is Lucifer, who was the first to put faith in mankind even before I had understood the need to let Humanity progress, and let Man go alone through the final test of resolving violence without an intervention on our part.'

Satan then told me that he thought there were not more than a dozen men like me on Earth. Love and fraternity shone from his face, and he was of the opinion that it was not because some rare exceptions existed, that Humanity deserved the right to exist.

Then we returned to the more spacious of the two ships, the one that would bring me to the planet of the Eternals, where my  initiation was to be completed. All of this is related in the book which contains the second message, *Extra-Terrestrials Took Me To Their* *Planet*.

## My Father Who Art in Heaven

On my first encounter with this extra-terrestrial, whom I did not then know to be Yahweh, the president of the Council of the  Eternals, I was wondering why they had chosen me to become their messenger on Earth. He told me that they had decided to "choose"  someone after the first atomic explosion at Hiroshima, which took place on August 6th 1945. Then he added: 'We have been following you since your birth, and even before.' (Refer to pg. 8 of *The Book* *Which Tells The Truth*).

In the beginning, I found this answer to be very intriguing, and during the two years between the first and second message, I often pondered on this subject.

I had to wait until I met Yahweh again to clarify this matter in full.

He revealed the truth of my origins at the end of his remarks addressed to the people of Israel, as reported in the second message when we were then on the planet of the Eternals.

Once again I was told to put on one of these belts with a large buckle, which enables one to travel in the air by following certain wave currents. I found myself flying about 20 meters above luxuriant vegetation after a smooth exit from the laboratory, where my mind had been modified in the strange shell-shaped chair.

In ten seconds or so, we had reached a paradisiacal clearing where a few prophets, with whom I had a meal earlier, were sitting. A few hundred meters below, I could see immense and magnificent sandy beaches, bordering on a sea of deep blue waters of such depth and beauty that none of the coves of the Mediterranean sea could match it, or even come close. The blue of the water was like that of a Californian swimming pool, but it spread out to the horizon, with great pink and green areas within the blue sea. When I looked more attentively, I could see traces of every color, each more beautiful than the next, as if the bottom of the sea had been painted for some 10  kilometers. I asked where these extraordinary colors had come from, and was told that the seaweed gave the water its coloration. The seaweed had been created and implanted artistically to produce the special effect that I had noticed.

The belt allowed me to descend gently in the small clearing near the group of ten or so prophets. The one who had been introduced to me as Jesus, came to meet us.

Following Yahweh, we all went and sat on seats carved out of the rock. All the seats were covered with this marvellous black fur which seemed to be alive. We were located on a cliff overlooking the sea.

Yahweh asked me if during the last two years since our first meeting, there had been some question which has preoccupied me more particularly. Without hesitation, I told him that I had often wondered what he had meant when he had explained, 'we have been following you since your birth and even before.'

I had twisted the question many times in my mind wondering if it had meant that my parents had been chosen before my conception, and if they had been guided telepathically to each other to bear me, or if they already knew each other when they were chosen, or if I had been conceived when they were chosen, or rather when the embryo which they had created was chosen.

Yahweh answered this question that was very important to me. His answer was even more extraordinary than I had anticipated.

At that moment, he stopped addressing me in French by the polite form of *vous* and started addressing me by the personal form of *tu*. He then said:

'The person whom you looked upon as your father was not your real father. After the explosion at Hiroshima, we decided that the time had come for us to send a new messenger on Earth. He would be the last prophet, but the first one to address Mankind asking them to understand and not to believe. We then selected a woman, as we had done in the time of Jesus. This woman was taken aboard one of our ships and inseminated as we had done with the mother of Jesus.

Then she was freed after we had totally erased from her memory all traces of what had happened.

But before all of this had happened, we had arranged so that she would meet a man, who could support the child financially and would raise him decently. This man had to be from a different religion than that of the woman so that the child could be raised without strong religious conditioning. This is why the man whom you took for your father and believed that he truly was, was a Jew.

Your real father is also the father of Jesus, and that makes you brothers. You are presently looking at your father. Your foster-father was like Joseph, he was to take care of you and your mother until such time as you could provide for yourself. From this moment on, you can talk to me using *tu*, because you are my son and I am your father.'

Of the entire journey, this was the most touching moment. And I could see in Yahweh's eyes an equally great emotion and feeling of love. Jesus too seemed to be moved by the same feelings. Then I kissed my father and my brother for the very first time.

Then Yahweh asked me not to reveal this parental tie until three years had passed. This is the reason why I have never talked about it until now.

In any case, it is of no importance, we must not make the same mistake as those men who recognized Jesus as a messenger who came from the heavens. It is not the messenger who is important, but the message itself.

'Jesus came on Earth to show the way but men kept looking at his finger.', said a great thinker, and it is unfortunately true.

I, Rael, am also showing you the path to follow, in revealing the messages given to me by my father "who is in heaven". It is more important to recognize the Elohim as our fathers and to prepare their embassy on Earth as they requested, than to pay attention to the messenger. Only the messages are important and through them the recognition of those who sent them, but not the messenger.

Do not look at my finger, but rather in the direction in which it's
pointed.

## Message from Yahweh to the Men of the Earth: The Apocalypse of the Final Nuclear Cataclysm

I, Yahweh, through the words of my prophet Rael, address all the people of Earth:

There is, unfortunately, but one chance in one hundred that your Humanity will not self-destroy, and every Raelian must act as if Mankind would be wise enough to understand and grab this tiny chance of escaping the final cataclysm, so as to enter the Golden Age.

Better still, each Raelian, by his work of awakening minds,  contributes to strengthening this unique and minute chance of survival to prevent it from becoming even weaker.

It is impossible to predict the future, for it is impossible to travel in time, but it is always possible to predict the future of a biological entity, and the whole of Humanity can be considered as a biological entity. If a primitive woman was inseminated by a scientist, the latter could predict this woman's future. He could predict that in nine months she would give birth to a child, and could even go so far as determining the sex of the child.

In the same way, we who are used to creating life on an infinity of planets, know what happens to a Humanity which has reached your level of technology, without having reached an equivalent level of wisdom.

This is why, although we cannot predict the future of individuals, we can predict, however, what should normally happen to a living organism during the gestation period or to a Humanity in the course of its development.

When the first cell is created in the mother's womb by the meeting of the spermatozoon and the ovule, this first cell contains all the necessary information to create a complete being, able to accomplish a multitude of functions. And the more numerous the cells, the more numerous are the functions developed. The number of functions is proportional to the number of cells obtained by successive divisions, until the child is ready to be born, because only then does he become a complete organism, with all the organs which he will require to accomplish all the functions which will fill his every need.

It is exactly the same thing for humanity, considering each human to be
like a cell of the great being in gestation, that is, Humanity.

The number of functions, of discoveries, and the technological level of Mankind is proportional to the number of humans. In this way, we can easily predict that the age of the Apocalypse will be achieved when Men are able to make the blind recover their sight with electronic prostheses, when Man's voice will be carried beyond the oceans through satellite telecommunication, and when Man will be equal to those he had mistaken for "God", by creating synthetic beings in a laboratory, etc. 

All these predictions rely on an in-depth knowledge of the biology of the species. We know that a foetus will develop his eyes at a certain month of his growth, and his sexual organs at another month, and that the same rule applies to all living species which are developing.

We know that it will make discoveries permitting the  ccomplishment of such and such a scientific prowess after so many undreds or thousands of years. It's exactly the same thing.

We have dictated our messages to the prophets of old, so as to be ecognized by men when the time would come for us to show

ourselves openly, without this creating new deistic religions, i.e. when ll men would be capable of understanding.

Among these texts is the *Apocalypse,* which we dictated to John. We howed him, through a visualizer similar to your television sets, the vents which would happen to men when they would reach the Age of the pocalypse.

The text of the Apocalypse of John was unfortunately overloaded and istorted by primitive transcribers who could not be anything other than od-believing people.

John starts his story by telling of his encounter with us:

I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great
voice, as of a trumpet.17 *Revelation 1: 10.*

Here he explains that he is trying to communicate with us  elepathically, this is what he calls being "in the spirit" on the unday, referred to as the "Lord's day", and that he heard a metallic oice "as of a trumpet"; this is something you all know: The sounds roduced by an electrical loudspeaker.

Then John turned around to see what was behind him:

Then I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a  garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band.

His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire; His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters;  He had in His right hand seven stars, out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and His countenance was like the sun shining in its strength.12 *Revelation 1: 12-16.*

John saw seven flying machines made of a golden metal, "seven golden lampstands", in the middle of which stood a little being, "one like the Son of Man", dressed in a flying suit which was molded to his body, even his feet, and he is wearing a large belt. His skin and his hair are white; his helmet is equipped with two small projectors which John mistook for his eyes. His feet are standing on thick, insulated soles of yellow metal, and he speaks with a powerful voice, "and his voice as the sound of many waters".

In his hand, the little person holds an apparatus made of seven luminous signals, which are bridged to the seven vessels placed near him. The two-edged sword, on the other hand, is only a detail added later on by the transcribers to reinforce the menace of apparition, to increase the power of "God" and the fear of "God" of the first Christians. The being who appeared in front of John was indeed one of us.

John, panic-stricken, fell with his face to the ground:

And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, 'Fear not; I am the first and the last, and the Living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades. Write  therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass hereafter.' *Revelation 1: 17-20*

We asked John to get up, and we told him that he must write  everything that he had seen, and everything that would be dictated to him, so that men could find those writings when the time would come. We told him that we were "the first and the last", that is to say, the first on Earth and the last if men self-destroy when they discover energies to permit them to do so. We explained to him that the one who was speaking had known death, but had been re-created, thanks to the process explained in the first message, which permits us to live eternally through many bodies.

And behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, a voice as of a trumpet speaking with me, one saying, Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which must come to pass hereafter.

Straightway I was in the Spirit: and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne.17 *Revelation 4: 1-2.*

John sees "a door opened in heaven"; the door of one of our  machines is opened, and he is taken inside on a carrying ray. This is totally incomprehensible for him, and this is why he says, "in the spirit".

There he sees someone sitting in a chair and around him a total of other people also sitting on "thrones".

I, Yahweh, was this person sitting on the throne, and around me were sitting 24 other Eternals representing the Council of the Eternals, the governing body of our planet.

Then I turned on the apparatus designed to visualize thoughts, and he saw what would normally happen to Humanity, and also what would happen when the time would come:

And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. *Revelation 6: 2.*

This is in relation to the first of the seven seals, or if you prefer, the seven chapters of the history of Humanity. This is, in fact, the triumph of Christianity on Earth, and it allows The Old Testament to be revealed to everyone. Then the second seal is opened:

And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. *Revelation 6: 4.*

This red horse represents the religious wars and wars in general, which will be one of the principal causes in the tardiness of humans to increase their number. Then comes the third seal:

And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.

And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, 'A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine'. *Revelation 6: 5-6.*

The black horse is the famine, which will claim a considerable number of lives before Mankind solves the problem on Earth completely. And then comes the fourth seal:

And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. *Revelation 6: 8.*

This pale horse represents the great epidemics and plagues, and many others which have decimated Humanity. Then the fifth seal is broken:

When He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held.

And they cried with a loud voice, saying, 'How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?'

Then a white robe was given to each of them; and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both the number of their fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was completed.12 *Revelation 6: 9-11.*

This scene represents what happened when the great prophets, living eternally in our company on our planet, asked us to allow men who had lived a positive life to be re-created before the final judgment. We gave permission so that a few thousand people from Earth, who we re-created, could live among us immediately, whereas first we had decided to keep their genetic code in order to re-create them only when Humanity had completed its evolution. Then the sixth seal was opened:

I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood. And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind.

Then the sky receded as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place.

And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man,  hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.12 *Revelation 6: 12-15.*

The sixth seal represents the final danger for Humanity, the greatest danger, the one which could destroy it completely: the atomic war. The "great earthquake" is the explosion itself, the "black sun" is the darkening of the sky by the mushroom cloud, and the fallout dust that you all know so well will darken the moon. "The sky receded as a scroll" is when the clouds are chased abruptly by the sudden surge of hot air coming from the explosion. The men who hide in the rocks of the mountains are the people who rush into anti-nuclear shelters. It is from this final cataclysm, if it happens, that people who will have followed our prophet, will be saved - those people who will have had their cellular plan transmitted after having read or heard of the messages.

Those people will have been selected by our huge computer, which follows all people from conception to death.

Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea, saying, 'Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.'12 *Revelation 7: 2-3.*

The people who will be sealed in the forehead will be those who will have their cellular plan transmitted by manual contact between our prophet and their forehead bone, which contains the purest and the most authentic genetic code. The total of those who will be  "sealed in the forehead" will be around 144,000, which will include those people already re-created on our planet, those people who will have led a life dedicated to the blossoming of Humanity without ever hearing of the messages, and also those people who will recognize Rael as our messenger after having read the messages.

For as long as the total of these human beings does not reach 144,000, we will help to delay the final cataclysm, so as to have a sufficient number to start a new generation on Earth, when it has become a suitable place again for humans to live.

If the sixth seal represents the discovery and the first utilization of the atomic weapon, the seventh seal represents the final cataclysm, a worldwide atomic war, which ends with the destruction of all life on Earth.

When the first trumpet of the seventh seal sounded:

...and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. *Revelation 8: 7.*

One third of the Earth is burnt by radioactivity; the trees and the green grass no longer grow.

And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed. *Revelation 8: 8-9.*

The explosion produced an enormous eruption of lava which ran into the ocean, destroying one third of the marine life and one third of the ships.

And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. *Revelation 8: 10-11.*

Atomic explosions follow in retort to the first attack; the missiles,  "great burning stars from Heaven", fall everywhere. Most of the drinking water becomes polluted, and many people die from it.

And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise. *Revelation 8: 12.*

The dust and the ashes raised by successive nuclear explosions are so thick that the sky is darkened, obscuring the Sun, the Moon and the stars, which gives the impression that the day and the night are shorter.

And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.

And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. *Revelation 9: 1-2.*

This is the description of a missile falling and the mushroom cloud it creates.

Then out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth. And to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.

They were commanded not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.

And they were not given authority to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.

In those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will desire to die, and death will flee from them. *Revelation 9: 3-6.*

The locusts are airplanes loaded with atomic bombs which will fall on the great cities, and through exposure to radioactivity, will inflict terrible suffering on those people who will have survived the explosions. They will be poisoned by radiation, in much the same way as one can be poisoned by the sting of a scorpion.

And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.

And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.

And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.

And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months. *Revelation 9: 7-10.*

Those metallic locusts covered with metal, looked like horses going to war, in the eyes of a primitive man. They had a cockpit inside of which a man's face could be seen "as the faces of men", and in flying very high, they left behind a trail of white smoke that John calls hair, and their "teeth" are the missiles tucked under their wings. The  "breastplates of iron" are the fuselage, and the noise comes from the jet engines, as is familiar to you. The power in the "tails like unto scorpions" is the radiation produced by the missiles which were dropped on the population of the countries that were attacked.

And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before Yahweh... *Revelation 9: 13.*

John describes the four loud-speakers located in front of me while I was making him see all this.

And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.

By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.

For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. *Revelation 9: 17-19.*

Again this is the description of more planes; the "heads of the horses" are the jet-engines from which flames and smoke come out.

The tail with "heads, with them they do hurt" are the nuclear missiles, and you can understand that the "heads" refers to the head of the missile, whether it's self-directed or not. We gave John the most detailed description possible, and this story reflects what he had seen with his primitive eyes. Take this same story and tell it to an Amazonian Indian, then ask him to write it down in his own words, and you will get approximately the same type of recollection, more so, if you ask 10 of his fellow tribe members to transcribe the story, while the first man is not present.

And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was

about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me,

'Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them
not.' *Revelation 10: 4.*

At this point we clearly told John that there was no "God" and that we
were men like him, and also we explained that he should keep this as a
secret and not write it, so as not to create a greater confusion among
the people who still needed a crutch to lean on, until the day when
Humanity had reached a sufficient level of technology when everyone
could understand what we had spoken of.

But in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, when he is about
to sound, the mystery of God would be finished, as He

declared to His servants the prophets.12 *Revelation 10: 7.*

We clearly explained to him that when the time would come, men would
understand that there is no "God" and by the same token would also
understand that we were their creators.

\...for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath,

because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.

*Revelation 12: 12.*

This final test of Humanity, that is, the choice between
self-destruction or the passage into the Golden Age, is the last

opportunity for Satan to prove that he was right in saying that humanity
was bad.

If Humanity brilliantly overcomes this last ordeal and succeeds in
obtaining total disarmament on the planet, then men will have proven
themselves worthy of receiving our inheritance, since they will have
shown they are truly non-violent. The "beast", as described further on
in the text, is simply the use of nuclear energy for murderous means:

303

[]{#index_split_006.html#p328}INTELLIGENT DESIGN: MESSAGE FROM THE
DESIGNERS

Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the

number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his

number is Six hundred threescore and six. *Revelation 13: 18.*

In fact, 666 is the number of human generations which will have existed
on Earth since the creation of the first men in the original
laboratories. The very first humans were created some 13,000 years ago,
and a human generation is estimated at an average of 20 years, so if one
multiplies 666 by 20, it equals 13,320 years.

The generation born at the beginning of the Age of Apocalypse in 1945 of
the Christian era, was in fact the 666th since the creation of the first
man in a laboratory by the Elohim. This generation coincides precisely
with the first use of nuclear energy for destructive purposes at
Hiroshima, on August 6th, 1945.

Once again, interpretation was not required in order to

understand. One had only to read what had been written. 666 was
effectively the "number of Man", the number of men who descended from
the creation, that is to say, the number of generations.

And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a
great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so
mighty an earthquake, and so great. *Revelation 16: 18.*

The after-shocks from the atomic explosions are tremendous, and they are
increased if they start a chain reaction.

And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.

*Revelation 16: 20.*

This monstrous explosion due to a chain reaction will brutally divide
the continents, engulfing the islands and sweeping the mountains like a
wisp of straw.

304

TO THE MEN OF THE EARTH

And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about
the weight of a talent. *Revelation 16: 21.*

In those parts of the Earth untouched by the bombs, rocks are falling
from the sky, thousands of kilometers away from where the bombs had
fallen.

And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the
first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.

*Revelation 21: 1.*

John was able to see what one could see from a rocket moving away from
the Earth. It seemed as if it was the Earth that was retreating, rather
than the craft itself moving away. Then the spacecraft travels through a
starlit sky unfamiliar to a man of the Earth, "a new Heaven". Then the
spaceship reaches another planet, "a new Earth".

And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from Yahweh out
of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her

husband. *Revelation 21: 2.*

Looking from the spacecraft, the primitive has the feeling that the city
towards which the spacecraft is going, is "coming down out of Heaven",
while it is evidently the spacecraft that is approaching.

And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, 'Behold, the tabernacle
of Yahweh is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be
his people, and Yahweh himself shall be with them, and be their Elohim.

And Yahweh shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be
no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any
more pain: for the former things are passed away.'

*Revelation 21: 3-4.*

305

[]{#index_split_006.html#p330}INTELLIGENT DESIGN: MESSAGE FROM THE
DESIGNERS

This is the description of the planet of the Eternals, where all the
people that we will save from the final cataclysm will live with us
while waiting to be re-implanted on Earth when it will be habitable
again, in order to re-create a peaceful civilization.

This is the outcome with which Humanity is faced, if it does not reach a
level of wisdom as high as its level of technology.

All this was seen by a primitive, because John was a primitive compared
to us, as was Moses, as was Jesus as well, as were all the prophets
compared to our level, before we gave them a sufficient initiation so
that they could foresee what was a certain mastery of matter. Your most
advanced scientists are also primitive compared to what we can achieve
today, the same as the Indians of the Amazon are, compared to the
scientists at Cape Canaveral.

This is, unfortunately, what awaits Humanity, with a 99 per cent
probability of occurring.

So that all of you who recognize us as your creators and who recognize
Rael as our last messenger on Earth, all of you must wrestle to ensure
that Humanity reaches out to this one little chance of survival, by
revealing our messages to the whole of Mankind. If this is what you are
doing, you can live in peace, and all the while try to expand and
fulfill yourselves even more, for if you are among the just, who are
doing everything within their power so that the truth and non-violence
may finally triumph, you can rest assured that we will save you from the
final cataclysm, if it should ever happen. Strive for love, strive for
fraternity, strive for intelligence, but do not despair if you see that
the great majority of men remain violent, aggressive and stupid.
Whichever way you look at it, your efforts will be rewarded.

Either Humanity will develop an interplanetary consciousness, and the
whole of Mankind will enter the Golden Age, or everything will explode,
and you will be those who we will save to rebuild everything.

I, Yahweh, the alpha and the omega, he who was the first one on Earth
and also he who will be the last, I am sending this message to all
humans of the Earth through the words of my prophet, Rael, to all those
humans whom we have created, and whom we have tried to 306

TO THE MEN OF THE EARTH

lead towards the Golden Age, and who we love as if they were our own
children.

Peace on Earth to all men of good-will and to all those who have the
will to be happy.

Our inheritance is ready, let us hope that the child will not die at
birth.

It's your move!
