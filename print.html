the publication of his first two books in the mid-1970s.</p>
<h2 id="seeming-contradictions-between-the-first-and-second-message"><a class="header" href="#seeming-contradictions-between-the-first-and-second-message">Seeming Contradictions Between the First and Second Message</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The first contradiction which appeared between the first and second message was found in the beginning of the dialogue which took place between the Eloha and you. In the first message, when you asked him if it would be possible to visit his planet, he replied:</p>
<p>'No, you could not live there because the atmosphere is very different from yours, and you are not sufficiently prepared to support the journey.' Nevertheless, at the time of the second meeting on October 7th, 1975 (31), you were taken in one of their machines, and you spent nearly 24 hours on the planet of the Eternals.</p>
<p>We would remark that on the first contact, the machine appeared progressively, showing a flashing red light at about ten meters altitude  and descending slowly. When the machine was low enough for you to see the upper part, a strong white light was flashing on its top, whereas at the time of contact for the delivery of the second message, the machine appeared instantly behind the bushes at Roc Plat, without any flashing lights and at ground level. Also, when it returned, it disappeared instantly once you had descended from it, as if it had disintegrated.</p>
<p>Another contradiction: At the time of the first contact, the Eloha had his face surrounded by some sort of halo, which he later explained was a sort of space helmet composed of waves, whereas at the time of the most recent meeting, he had nothing surrounding his face. This contradiction is elsewhere strengthened by what is stated on page 30 in the first message: 'Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live', <em>Exodus 33:20,</em> and this biblical citation is explained thus: 'If man came on our planet, he would see the creators without their space helmets, but he would die because the atmosphere would not be suitable for him.' How do you explain this?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The explanation for these seeming contradictions is very simple and can be summarized in one word: psychology.</p>
<p>When one decides to come and make contact with a person living on a primitive planet, even though he was created to accomplish a very specific mission, there are certain precautions which must be taken so as not to irreversibly damage his psyche. To see a machine appearing in the sky equipped with flashing lights is not traumatic for a man living in a scientifically developed country of our time. He is more or less used to seeing satellites and rockets on TV and has already seen airplanes and helicopters since his childhood and understands, to some extent, how they operate. The best way to make an appearance without frightening him is to make a gradual approach with a machine equipped with flashing lights like his own airplanes and helicopters, well known to him.</p>
<p>Man would find that almost normal and would only be surprised at the absence of noise from a machine seemingly made of metal, and consequently very heavy. The being who appeared to him would have to be dressed in a way resembling how man expects present air pilots and astronauts to be dressed. The sort of space helmet covering the face would give him confidence, by reminding him of the pilots of Earth's flying machines with which he was well acquainted. Thus they would be able to reach their objective not to panic the person contacted, and at the same time allowing him to see technology which is still unknown to people on Earth, so that he will understand that he has discovered visitors from another planet.</p>
<p>At the time of the second encounter, when the flying machine appeared more brutally, the Elohim were using their technology without camouflage before a witness whom they knew was sufficiently prepared psychologically so as not to be traumatized. If they had appeared so brutally at the first encounter, the shock would have been too great, and my mental balance would have been too disturbed at that time, when I wasn't expecting anything. In spite of all their precautions, the nervous shock brought on the beginning of stomach ulcers, which took several months to heal. The message was &quot;sweet in my mouth, but bitter in my stomach&quot;. It would have been even more serious without the approach precautions which they took.</p>
<p>Up to our present day and age, our creators were only appearing while trying to impress their creation to the maximum, as incapable as they were to understand who these beings from the sky were. The Elohim's main objective was to make Man believe, even if they did not understand. Now that we are reaching the Age of Apocalypse, which means the &quot;Age of Revelation&quot;, that is to say, the age when everything can be understood, and not the &quot;end of the world&quot;, as some would like you to believe and as you can check in any dictionary, they have decided to appear while trying to be understood and recognized as our creators, those of which all the religious books of the Earth are talking, including <em>The Bible</em>, in which they are called the &quot;Elohim&quot;. This bible was dictated to the first human beings precisely with the aim to be recognized, now that millennia have passed and human knowledge has progressed sufficiently. In this way, we can look at what is coming from the sky without kneeling to pray and shouting &quot;miracle&quot;.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be remembered that the Elohim had decided to test me before giving me the complete message, so they went at it most progressively.</p>
<p>In spite of my insistent wish to take a trip in their vessel, they cut short my demands by stating that it was impossible for me to do so, just as people sometimes tell their children that if they drank alcohol they would stop growing. They added the example of the verse in <em>Exodus,</em> which they addressed to primitive men so that they would stay aloof. These primitives were meant to believe without, above all, trying to understand.</p>
<h2 id="dating-the-works-of-the-elohim"><a class="header" href="#dating-the-works-of-the-elohim">Dating the Works of the Elohim</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The Elohim said they created life on Earth 25,000 years ago. How is it that we find traces of animal bones as old as many hundreds of thousands of years?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The Elohim have explained that they did not create our planet.</p>
<p>When they decided to pursue their experiments of creating life scientifically in a laboratory, they set out to search the universe for a planet which would have a suitable atmosphere, allowing them to work easily. The Earth proved to be positive after many tests and analyzes.</p>
<p>Then they came down to our planet and created the life forms we now know, including humans. It doesn't mean, that 10,000 or 20,000 years before their arrival, there wasn't another creation on Earth that could have been destroyed by a natural or an artificial catastrophe.</p>
<p>Imagine that an atomic war breaks out tomorrow, and all life on Earth is destroyed. Then 10,000 years later, extra-terrestrials settle down to create new living organisms, intelligent beings who would discover traces of our civilization after a slow scientific progression; these same beings would find it hard to believe that beings coming from the sky had created them scientifically, using as proof the bones which they found to be older than 25,000 years, our bones! They might even find the far older bones of mammoths that we ourselves still find existing in the debris of our time because the life that exists on Earth at present is not the first one to be created, and it won't be the last.</p>
<p>There has been an infinity of creations on our planet, but also an infinity of destructions, due for the most part to a lack of wisdom by those who were the equivalent to our humanity.</p>
<h2 id="the-people-of-israel-and-the-jews"><a class="header" href="#the-people-of-israel-and-the-jews">The People of Israel and the Jews</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>In the first message, on page 18, it is written that the people of Israel were elected at one of the Elohim's competitions, as the most successful humanoids as far as intelligence and genius are concerned.</p>
<p>Then in the second message on page 170, it is written 'The Jews are our direct descendants on Earth. That is why a special destiny is reserved for them. They are the descendants of the 'Sons of Elohim and the daughters of men', as written in <em>Genesis</em>. Is this not contradictory? </p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The people who were chosen by our creators, the Elohim, as being the most accomplished, were the people of Israel, who had been created in a laboratory at this location on our planet. It is perhaps because these people were the greatest success that the Sons of the Elohim were tempted by their females and had children by them, from whom the Jewish people descend. That is how the race populating the soil of Israel became the Jewish people.</p>
<h2 id="the-raelian-movement-and-money"><a class="header" href="#the-raelian-movement-and-money">The Raelian Movement and Money</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>In the first book, it is written on page 86:</p>
<p>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth... No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve Yahweh and mammon. <em>Matthew 6: 19-24.</em></p>
<p>And the Vatican is vigorously attacked for its riches, while the Raelian Movement is asking for money from its members. Is it not falling into the same trap as the Vatican?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>One must not compare those who live in luxury and opulence, recommending their faithful to live poorly, and who use these poorpeople's money to maintain a myriad of bishops and cardinals, toincrease continually their real estate investments, to maintain a palaceof another era with guards wearing halberds; one must not compare these Roman usurpers with a movement that has not, nor will ever have, a paid clergy: that had not, nor will ever own three-quarters of the houses and real estate in a capital where people are having problems finding suitable lodgings, as is the case in Rome, where they refuse to rent to whoever it may be for fear of devaluation of the investment; that has not, and never will have a princely palace crumbling under the heaviness of gold and silver.</p>
<p>We have indeed a need for a lot of money, but it will be used to attain these precise objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Translate the messages of the Elohim into every language, and bring them to the attention of all the peoples of the Earth.</li>
<li>Build an embassy where the Elohim will be able to meet men officially. This embassy will be neither a princely palace nor a cathedral, but rather a simple house possessing the comforts to which all modern men are entitled, with the kind of diplomatic immunity that even the smallest state has for its embassy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, if by good fortune, we succeed in obtaining more money than we need to realize the first two objectives that I have already pointed out, and in such a short space of time that we have not yet managed the diffusion of the message all over the planet, we will then use the excess money to build a research centre near the embassy. This centre will bring together all the scientists who wish to work on the creation of life in a laboratory, allowing Mankind to equal their creators. The creation of biological robots will allow the elimination of work and consequently money. Also, we plan to build a school for the geniuses and the gifted. These research teams will be able to work freely, outside the exploiting laboratories, the multinational trusts and the suffocation of geniuses by state systems.</p>
<p>In this way they will have the opportunity to work without fear of seeing their inventions fall into the hands of politico-military powers, seeking to use new discoveries to build ever more destructive armaments.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-is-constant-in-space-and-time"><a class="header" href="#nothing-is-constant-in-space-and-time">Nothing is Constant in Space and Time</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>In the first book on page 89, you wrote that the planet of the Elohim is a little less than a light year away, that being the distance that light can travel in one year, or nine thousand billion kilometers, since light moves at about three hundred thousand kilometers per second. Our present day scientists state that the closest star outside our sun is located four light years away. How do you explain the difference?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The Elohim do not want us to know exactly where their planet is located. This is quite understandable when we consider man's persistence towards destruction, even though the level of technology on Earth is still fairly primitive.</p>
<p>That will all be revealed in more detail when they will officially arrive in the embassy that we will build for them. In the meantime, we can only ask questions.</p>
<p>Scientific members of our movement have put forth an hypothesis: the distance between their planet and ours could be about four light years by following the light, which could be moving in a pronounced curve, but would only be one light year away if we travelled in a straight line. That is a possibility.</p>
<p>I might add that light does not move at the same speed in all strata of the universe, because nothing is invariable, neither in space nor time. This is one of the biggest errors that present scientists are committing. They start with an observation based on a limited period of time to draw conclusions bearing on the past thousands of years and on the time to come, or they base conclusions on a limited space, to draw conclusions on the infinity of space. Man has always made the same mistake of judging according to his knowledge. Those who used the horizon as a base reasoned that the Earth had to be flat. </p>
<p>This is also true for historical dating, such as the methods based on radioactivity named &quot;Carbon 14&quot;, potassium-argon, uranium-lead-thorium or all other such methods. There exists a very interesting book which explains all of this very seriously for the scientists who might be interested: I am referring to <em>Evolution or Creation</em> (see bibliography at the end of this book). In short, the error in these dating methods is to start with the principle that the present atomic movement has always been the same, and starting from there, to make calculations based on false information, because nothing is invariable in the universe in time or in space.</p>
<p>To illustrate this error, let's take a 25 year old human, for example, and measure his growth in one year, about one millimeter is a good average for most subjects. Starting from there, we could establish that the man is 1,750 years old, because he measures 1.75 meters. We would forget that the growth of this young man has never been invariable. The first year, he grew more than 500 millimeters (since conception), between four and five years only 60 millimeters, between seven and eight years only 30 millimeters, but between 14  and 15 years another 80 millimeters! As you will see, nothing is constant, all efforts to determine the subject's age, starting from a partial observation of his growth, would be a total failure. One could note that if we started at 60 centimeters in the first year of growth, to estimate the age of the person, in 21 years of such growth, we could predict that this individual would measure 12.6 meters at age 21. </p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>In the first book on page 13, you wrote that the Elohim had created the original continent 25,000 years ago, from which fragments later detached to form the continents we now know. The merican continent continued to separate itself from Europe by a few entimeters each year according to certain scientists, or by a metre ach year as others claim. Be that as it may, even if it is one metre er year, in twenty-five thousand years, we will reach 25,000 meters or 25 kilometers, but the North American continent is many thousands of kilometers away from Europe. How can this be explained?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The reply to this question is exactly the same as to the previous question. In the growth pattern of a human being, the relation between the first year and the 21st year is 600 to one. It is a thousand times greater when we speak of the separation of the continents.</p>
<p>Here again nothing is invariable neither in time nor space.</p>
<p>Actually, the continents separate only a few centimeters each year perhaps, but in the beginning, they separated by many hundreds of kilometers each year.</p>
<p>Recently there occurred an earthquake near the Arabian peninsula, and people were surprised to note that a fault was created, separating two regions by a metre in only one night.</p>
<p>And yet we are in a relatively calm period of the Earth's history, the side effects of &quot;the storm&quot; of the creation of the original continent by our Fathers have had time to calm down in 25 millennia. In the infinity of time and space, nothing is invariable, not in matter, not in energy.</p>

<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>It is asked of all those who recognize Rael as having been sent by our creators, the Elohim, and being the last of the prophets, to have their cellular plan transmitted by him, or by a Guide qualified to officiate by him, all this so that the genetic code of each Raelian may be preserved, so as to permit an eventual re-creation on the planet of the Eternals. On the other hand, each Raelian is also asked to take the necessary precautions in his or her will, so that the forehead bone be sent to the Guide of Guides after his or her death; to what will that avail, since the transmission of the cellular plan has already taken place?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The transmission of the cellular plan is a recognition of the Elohim as being our creators, performed by each Raelian while still alive. The conservation of the forehead bone is a recognition of the Elohim as being our creators, even after death. Together they constitute a recognition &quot;in life as in death&quot;. The cellular plan or genetic code of each individual is registered in an enormous computer which records all our actions during our life, from the time of our conception, from the meeting of the ovule and the spermatozoon, the moment when a new genetic code is registered, hence a new individual. This individual will be followed throughout his lifetime, and at the end of his life, the computer will know if he has the right to eternal life on the planet where the Elohim accept only the most conscious of men and women.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>What happens to a Raelian who dies in an accident and whose body is completely destroyed?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>If the Raelian in question has taken precautions in his will, asking that his forehead bone be sent to the Guide of Guides, there is no problem, since it will be registered by the computer which surveys every one of us during the whole of our existence. In the same way, there is no problem for the Raelians who die without the authorities respecting their last will and testament, by refusing the removal of the said forehead bone. What is important is that each Raelian make his or her will known in the manner asked.</p>
<p>When there will be millions of Raelians, the government will be forced to see that their last will and testament are respected by law.</p>
<p>The last will and testament of the first Christians were not respected either, so long as they were in a minority. Raelism will be the dominant religion in the world of the third millennium, and then the last will and testament of all Raelians will be respected.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The majority of people die old. Are they re-created old, and will they live eternally old?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>Obviously not! A person who is fortunate in being re-created to live eternally on the planet of the Eternals is re-created young with a body in full possession of its force and its resources. At each recreation, they will be re-created the same way eternally.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>It is written that only those who follow you will be saved. If a person has had a life turned towards happiness and the blossoming of humanity, but has never heard of the messages of the Elohim, has that person no chance of being saved?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>This person is among the just and will be saved. That part of the messages concerns those who have read the messages. Among them, only those who have decided to follow the rules given by our creators will be saved. But if there are people on Earth who live in seeking above all to help the progress of humanity, or to help their fellow men to the most of their ability, and who die without having known the messages of our Fathers, they will be among the just and will be saved. It will be more pardonable for those who do not know about the messages and who act positively than for those who know of them, because the latter have no excuse not to have changed their conduct or to have paid even more attention to their actions.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-earth-an-atom-of-the-finger-of-god"><a class="header" href="#is-the-earth-an-atom-of-the-finger-of-god">Is the Earth an Atom of the Finger of God?</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The message explains that our planet is but an atom of an atom of the gigantic being of which we are just a part, just as there is intelligent life in the atoms of the atoms of which we are composed.</p>
<p>But the great being of which we are only a part, could it not be considered as &quot;God&quot;?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>It all depends on what we mean by the word <em>God</em>. If we are thinking of Infinity, then yes, but only in part; because this gigantic being of which we are only a part, also lives on a planet which is an atom of another gigantic being and so on to infinity.</p>
<p>If we mean by &quot;God&quot; a being having power over us, not at all, because there is no such &quot;God&quot;.</p>
<p>The infinitely great being of which the Earth is but an atom, has no power over us, because one must not forget that for that being, time passes much more slowly. The time it takes for that being to think of something, for us a few millennia have passed. The time taken for beings who live on one of the atoms of our atoms to think of something, is for us, a billionth of a billionth of a second. This infinitely small being could think that we are &quot;God&quot;, and would be just as wrong as us if we considered the being that we are a part of to be something divine. The universe being infinite, there can be no centre, which eliminates the possibility of the existence of an all-powerful and omnipresent God!</p>
<p>The Infinite is omnipresent, and we are a part of it as it is a part of us. But it has no power over us, and it is &quot;infinitely&quot; indifferent to our decisions or our behavior. After all, there is nothing to prove that the great being of whose particles we are the parasites, is human. It is perhaps a dog or a worm (the only thing that could be proven by the Elohim is that it is something alive).</p>
<h2 id="noahs-ark----a-space-craft"><a class="header" href="#noahs-ark----a-space-craft">Noah's Ark -- A Space Craft?</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The messages state that Noah's Ark was a spaceship. However, there was a discovery a few years ago in a glacier on Mount Ararat of the remains of a boat, which some claimed to be the debris from Noah's Ark which, it would appear, was a boat. How do you explain that?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The pieces of wood which were found have recently been analyzed, and it was estimated they were not older than seven hundred years, which would put Noah's Ark at around AD1200. Even if we admit that the dating system makes enormous errors, and that one</p>
<p>multiplies the dating by three, one would obtain two thousand years, which would place the flood at the beginning of the Christian era, which makes no sense. Even if one day the remains of a wooden boat were found dating back about five thousand years, which would correspond with the period of the flood, that would not prove that Noah's Ark was a wooden boat. One would certainly find near Mount Ararat pieces of a wooden boat dating back to the epoch of the true flood, because at the time when Noah built his spaceship destined to save certain humans from destruction, there were in the ports of his country some wooden boats, which had been carried by the enormous tidal waves at the time of the huge explosions responsible for the destruction of all life on Earth. Just as today we can find in Florida, not far from the modern American rocket-site which carried the astronauts to the Moon, some magnificent sailing boats constructed with wood, and superb yachts belonging to American millionaires.</p>
<p>In the case of an atomic war, certain explosions could activate enormous tidal waves, which would carry away the boats to the tops of the closest mountains, like pieces of straw. The eventual survivors could, on finding the debris of those boats some centuries later, deduce that there must have been an enormous flood to carry them there; and, since certain writings report that some humans had been saved from this flood, having been protected on board a vessel, they would be certain that these would be the vessels in question.</p>
<p>There is a very important point which helps us to understand clearly that the flood was not the result of a continual rainfall as is generally thought, but the result of a colossal cataclysm, having completely, and in a very brutal manner, overturned the surface of the Earth. If it had been caused by continual rain, all the boats would have been saved, and of course all the sailors and navigators of that epoch would have survived without the least problem. Now it is clearly written that only those who were in Noah's Ark survived, which makes sense, it being the only spaceship!</p>
<h2 id="life-after-life----or-dream-and-reality"><a class="header" href="#life-after-life----or-dream-and-reality">Life After Life -- or Dream and Reality?</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>A book was published recently which related the testimonies of people who were brought back to life after having been in a coma, and nearly all of them told the same story of the visions they had as death approached -- a vision of harmonious people wearing white robes and singing, a vision of people who had disappeared, etc. You claim that after death there is nothing if the Elohim do not intervene to re-create those who die. How do you explain this consistency in testimony, and does it not prove the existence of a soul?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>All that happens in the human brain is but the result of electro-chemical reactions. Be it of love, of hate, of pleasure, of suffering, of imagination, or all other states of mind, sentiment or sickness; the process depends in every case on the chemical reactions produced in the interior of the brain, and the resulting electrical impulses or messages, be they visual, auditory, based on memory, or an interpretation of new events based on elements that one has in the memory.</p>
<p>When we breathe very deeply and rapidly, we feel elated very soon, and if we make one hundred people do the same thing, their experience will all be consistent. If we make one hundred people run one kilometer, they will all be out of breath. Every given phenomenon corresponds to a given physical reaction, which will be the same for everyone. When an individual falls into a coma, the brain is irrigated by the blood in a certain manner, and the brain cells are thus oxygenated in a certain way, and these chemical facts produce certain reactions which are about the same for all of us.</p>
<p>If we place acid on limestone, it will always make a foam. If we hit the heads of one hundred people strong enough for them to fall into a coma, they will all have the impression of having seen the same thing. Indeed, they would describe only that which was stored in their memory of the chemical reactions to which they were subjected.</p>
<p>It is a bit like when we dream. Nobody would think of saying that because he met 10 other people who all dreamt that they were being chased by a bull that was 10 meters high and spitting flames, that since many people reported the same thing, these sorts of bulls must exist. We have all dreamt, at one time or another, that we could fly, just by giving a little push with our feet; but no one seriously believes that this proves that they can fly around with the swallows, or that such a thing would be possible, because thousands of people have had the same dream. One must not interpret these dreams as reality, even if science endeavors to realize them technically, by building an apparatus one day which really allows us to fly. Something which all of those who were in a coma remember well, is that they were not anxious to return to their body, and this is really not surprising. It would be more accurate to say that they had no desire to be conscious of their body again, just as when we come out of a very sweet dream in the company of the opposite sex, for example, and we try to go back to sleep to recapture the happiness which we experienced.</p>
<p>The fact that all ex-comatose people describe almost the same experience proves that identical chemical reactions were produced in the human brain, hence their reactions to electrical phenomena are also identical. If we implant electrodes in 1,000 human brains, in exactly the same locations, and we send them an identical electrical charge, they will all feel the same thing and have the same visions.</p>
<p>This is exactly what happens at the time of death. If certain privileged people deserve re-creation on the planet of the Eternals after their death, this will happen only when total death has occurred, and nothing will happen so long as the person is in a coma, therefore alive.</p>
<h2 id="the-elohims-scientific-level-of-development"><a class="header" href="#the-elohims-scientific-level-of-development">The Elohim's Scientific Level of Development</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>There does not seem to be as great a time-lag as one would expect between our creators and us, even though they are 25,000 years ahead of us. Their slow progression gives us the impression that we will be able to accomplish the same things in much less time. How is that?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>In order to report what I have seen, I used words that people of today can understand, while placing myself psychologically at the level of the most numerous of those who live in technologically developed countries. In fact, we cannot even begin to imagine the capacity and the technological level of the Elohim. What we are doing at the end of the 20th century of the Christian era would seem miraculous to Europeans who lived only 100 years ago, as well as to the Amazon Indians now living in their forests, but what our creators can do would seem equally miraculous to our most advanced  scientists, if they were showing it to them. Normally, the Elohim will not do it because they don't want to place us in a state of incomprehension that would inevitably lead to giving value back to beliefs that generate primitive religions. In this way, the Elohim hope that we will continue, above all, to seek to understand matter and the forces which surround us, by ourselves.</p>
<p>In the same manner in which they appeared to me with flashing lights and a sort of space suit so as not to disorientate me too much at the beginning, while they are able to appear instantly at ground level as they did at the meeting at Roc Plat, they could also show humanity technological prowess that even the most imaginative scientists could not understand by themselves.</p>
<p>They are capable of doing certain things with infinitely large particles such as planets and even entire solar systems, which we still find hard to do with infinitely small particles such as neutrons or electrons. What I mean is that they are able to modify the movements of planets within solar systems, and even displace some entire solar systems. They are able to do all this by using waves which we are not even aware of yet.</p>
<p>Let's go back to what was written in the first two messages. We must admit that between our present level of science on Earth and the mastery of scientific re-creation allowing eternal life, for example, there is a giant step that our scientists will take a long time to make, even if it is not entirely inconceivable for the most open-minded of them.</p>
<h2 id="neither-god-nor-soul-but-the-elohim-and-the-genetic-code"><a class="header" href="#neither-god-nor-soul-but-the-elohim-and-the-genetic-code">Neither God nor Soul, but the Elohim and the Genetic Code</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>It is written in the messages that there is no God since the universe, being infinite in space, could have no centre, and there is no soul for much the same reasons. But could it not be said that the Elohim replace &quot;God&quot; in the minds of many Raelians, and that the possibility of being re-created on the planet of the Eternals, replaces the idea of a &quot;soul&quot;, allowing access to &quot;paradise&quot;?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>Yes, there is no &quot;God&quot;. The universe is infinite and therefore cannot have a centre by definition because of it being infinite.</p>
<p>However, it is necessary to differentiate between those for whom &quot;God&quot; is a concept meaning infinity, something eternal, omnipresent, impalpable, and having no power over man and those for whom &quot;God&quot; is a being with a white beard sitting on a cloud who created humans in his image.</p>
<p>Since the beginning, there has been a conglomeration between two concepts, between two totally different things, that were unjustly put together under the same label. The Elohim explained to the first humans that on the one hand, there is Infinity, which is omnipresent and eternal and of which we are a part and which is part of us, and on the other hand, themselves, the Elohim, who created us in their image.</p>
<p>Little by little the properties of the Infinite were affiliated to the Elohim, and this is partly true because they are eternal; and to the Infinite, the power of manifestation through Celestial Messengers, is partly true again, because in a certain way, the Elohim could be considered as the instrument of the Infinite in their creation of intelligent beings in their image.</p>
<p>But the Infinite does not constantly watch over us directly and in itself is not conscious of our individual behavior. Whether mankind reaches the Golden Age or self-destructs is of no importance to the Infinite, no more than us paying attention to the molecule of our fingers which we leave on a fabric when we touch it. In relation to the Infinite, it is quite normal that there would be a natural selection at all levels, the same as for the man or the dog of which the Earth is but an atom of its skull or finger nail, and the same for the sun which illuminates it, or for the billions of inhabited planets that can be found in our thumb-nail.</p>
<p>Those who think of &quot;God&quot; as Infinity, as most oriental religions teach, are right, in as much as it represents a concept without identity, and without consciousness of our own existence, or any other for that matter.</p>
<p>Those for whom &quot;God&quot; is our creators, the Elohim, are not entirely wrong either, so long as they do not think of them as beings who must be worshiped on hands and knees or lying down with one's face in the dirt, but of elder brothers in the Infinite, whom we should love as we wish to be loved by the beings that we will create one day.</p>
<p>The spirit is a concept, whose etymology we will trace so as to better understand its meaning. The word <em>spirit</em> comes from the Latin <em>spirare</em> which means &quot;to breathe&quot; and the word <em>soul</em> comes from the same root as the French word <em>souffle</em>, also meaning &quot;breath&quot;. We can analyze the exact composition of the human body, then mix together all the chemical constituents, but we will not obtain a living being for all that. Something will be missing, something which is needed to assemble, to articulate, to organize it in a well defined plan. Take all that is required to build the house of your dreams, such as 10 tons of stones, a ton of cement, 100 kilos of paint, two wash basins, a bath, etc., and put it all in a heap. Nevertheless, we would not obtain a house because the most important thing is missing: the plan. The creation of a person follows the same principle, there has to be a plan.</p>
<p>This plan is the genetic code, which means that by assembling a minute quantity of matter to form the first cell containing a cellular plan, we would consider that person is, in fact, nearly completed.</p>
<p>This first cell would use the matter we give it as food to multiply in two, then four, then eight cells, and so on, following a precise plan until all the information contained in the genetic specifications has been met.</p>
<p>Each and every living being possesses a genetic code, which differs according to the species, or depending on individuals belonging to the same species, in certain details, such as the color of the eyes, the hair, the character, etc. Even <em>The Bible</em> states clearly that each living being possesses a &quot;soul&quot; and not only man:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But flesh with the soul thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the soul of man. <em>Genesis 9: 4-5</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the soul of the flesh is in the blood. <em>Leviticus 17: 11</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, there is no ethereal soul flying gracefully from the body after death, but there is the genetic code, which is the personality of each individual. It is through this genetic code that the Elohim proceed to re-create those people whose life on Earth is worthy of eternal life on their planet.</p>
<p>There is no &quot;God&quot;, but there are the Elohim, our creators who we wish to welcome as they deserve to be welcomed, and in whom we have faith, or rather trust. Also, there is no autonomous soul flying from the body after death, but there is the genetic code which allows access to eternal life.</p>
<h2 id="the-religion-of-the-infinite"><a class="header" href="#the-religion-of-the-infinite">The Religion of the Infinite</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The Raelian Movement is an atheist religion whose goals are the diffusion of the messages of demystification, given by the Elohim, to the Earth's population, and to build an embassy where they will make official contact with the governments of the Earth. Supposing that humanity showed proof of wisdom and succeeded in avoiding self-destruction, that the messages would be diffused in every language, that the embassy is built and that the Elohim arrive; what will be the function of the Raelian religion then, and what will its mission be?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>If all that comes about, and I am of the opinion that it will, even if there is only one chance in a hundred that man will choose the path of wisdom, humanity's religion will become that of the Elohim -- the Infinite. The mission of the Raelian Guides will then be the teaching of the techniques allowing man to live in harmony with the Infinite.</p>
<p>These techniques are summarily explained in <em>The Keys</em> in the second message and in <em>Sensual Meditation</em>. In other words, all of that which enables man to raise his level of consciousness, to refine his perception of the electro-chemical reactions and interchanges produced
in his brain.</p>
<p>The religion of the Infinite is the religion of the absolute, and it is inevitably eternal. The mere fact that people, 25,000 years ahead of us scientifically, are still faithful to this religion, is the proof that this is the absolute religion, the eternal religion for all the living species who have reached a universal level of consciousness, that is to say Infinite.</p>
<p>The awakening sessions that we organize regularly constitute an approach to this religion of the Infinite through sensual meditation.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-traditional-religions"><a class="header" href="#the-future-of-traditional-religions">The Future of Traditional Religions</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>If the Elohim come to the embassy accompanied by Moses, Jesus, Buddha, and Mohammed, and all the great prophets who live on the planet of the Eternals, what will become of the existing religions?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The majority would rally to the Raelian Movement, at least those churchgoers who are faithful to the writings of these religions, and who are sufficiently intelligent and open-minded enough to understand. Unfortunately, a great number of narrow minded fanatics, guided by the clergy of these religions afraid of losing their source of revenue, will oppose the general rally. They will allege that the Elohim are usurpers, or that they have been sent by &quot;the devil&quot;, and facing their own Christ, they would joyfully crucify him again, just as the clergy of the Inquisition would have burned Jesus as a sorcerer in his own name if he had had the misfortune to fall into their hands in that epoch.</p>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to have breakfast with one of the representatives of the Jewish community in Montreal, Quebec.</p>
<p>During the meal, I asked him what he would do if Moses himself told him to do otherwise than that which is written in <em>The Old Testament</em>.</p>
<p>He replied: 'I would continue to apply that which is written in <em>The Bible</em>.'</p>
<p>Many people are like him, and this is one of the problems with which the Elohim are confronted as they seek recognition from humanity. They will have to be stronger than the beliefs that they have engendered.</p>
<p>If tomorrow the Elohim landed somewhere in the world and explained to the governors who came to meet them, and to the media, that &quot;God&quot; does not exist, nor the soul, and presented Jesus in the flesh, saying who he is, do you believe that the Vatican would place its fortune at his disposal? Certainly not, because the system has taken the upper hand over the fundamental goals of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>All nuns are the wives of Jesus. Would they place themselves at his service if he returned? To be the wives of someone who does not exist materially, believing that he is alive somewhere, and being worried if he really returned: that is the problem of the nuns.</p>
<p>As a great thinker once said: we cannot change the minds of people, they simply die and are replaced by others more evolved who have
a different opinion. Time is on our side.</p>
<p>Certainly there will always be a small nucleus of narrow-minded fanatics, but they will die out, the same as the pre-Christian religions who martyred the first Christians, and whose beliefs have nevertheless totally disappeared.</p>
<p>The problem only will arise if the Elohim arrive before the present primitive beliefs have totally disappeared.</p>
<h2 id="raelism-and-geniocracy"><a class="header" href="#raelism-and-geniocracy">Raelism and Geniocracy</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>You published a book entitled: <em>Geniocracy</em>, from which a political movement was formed called: The Movement for Worldwide</p>
<p>Geniocracy. Are you not trying to use a religious movement to impose a political doctrine?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>Many Raelians were particularly interested by the chapter in the first message, which explained what the political organization was like on the planet of the Elohim, and asked me to develop this idea in a manifesto which would help them to create a political movement following this ideology. The fact that the Elohim wanted us to favor the implantation of geniocracy on Earth, and at the same time, leave men free to understand something better if they could, prompted me to agree to write this manifesto. Later, the few Raelians more particularly interested in geniocracy, created the party in question, and even presented a candidate at an election only a few months after its creation.</p>
<p>My position is very clear in all the countries where geniocracy is progressing. I am on Earth primarily to accomplish my mission, which consists of spreading the messages of our creators and building the embassy that they have requested. Those who are involved with geniocracy know that I devote all my time to my mission, and that even though I wish them the best of results, I do not feel concerned with their problems. I have even asked all the Guides who have started these political movements to find, as quickly as possible, other non-Raelians capable of replacing them, so that the Guides in question can devote themselves to that which, in my opinion, is more important: their work
as Guides.</p>
<p>If geniocratic candidates do seek to be elected, I will always advise the Raelians to vote for them. It becomes quite evident that a person can be a Raelian and a &quot;Geniocrat&quot;, just as one can be a Democrat and a Christian; one can have a religion and a political opinion.</p>
<p>Raelians do not have to get involved with the Geniocratic party, in fact, quite the contrary. I am convinced that people can do only one thing at a time, at least very well, so I advise Raelians not to become active in the Geniocratic party, but to leave that to non-Raelians.</p>
<p>When one works eight hours a day and spends all one's free time diffusing the messages, each free moment becomes precious. Not a single minute should be wasted on a political movement when it could be spent diffusing the messages. One must make a choice, and a political ideology does not weigh very much when compared with the messages of the Elohim. I have set the ball rolling with geniocracy, and I am now counting on non-Raelians to run it. Perhaps it will develop into something enormous which will save humanity, or perhaps humanity will save itself without geniocracy, even if they come to it later. The only important thing is that the embassy will soon be built; this is my only concern, my only preoccupation, and it should be the only concern and the only preoccupation of all true Raelians. The priority of priorities is the building of the embassy for our creators, so that we can welcome them in the company of the ancient messengers: Moses, Jesus, Buddha, and Mohammed. This is my only reason for being on this Earth. This must become the only reason for living for all those people who wish to help me.</p>
<h2 id="who-created-the-creator-of-the-creators"><a class="header" href="#who-created-the-creator-of-the-creators">Who Created the Creator of the Creators?</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The Elohim created us, and other people from another planet created them. Who created the creators of the Elohim?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The Infinite in space is easier for man to understand than the Infinite in time.</p>
<p>Once we have attained sufficient open-mindedness, we can understand that in space the Earth is but a particle of the atom of the atoms of the hand of a gigantic being, who contemplates a starlit sky which composes the hand, the stomach or the foot of a being even more gigantic, who finds himself under a sky, etc., etc., ad infinitum.</p>
<p>The same process applies for the infinitely small. On the atom of the atoms of our hands, there exist intelligent beings for whom these particles are planets and stars, and these beings are composed of atoms of which the particles are the stars and the planets on which there are intelligent beings, etc., etc., also to infinity.</p>
<p>Infinity in time becomes more difficult for Man to understand because Man is born one day, he lives a certain number of years and dies, but he would like everything in the universe to be limited in time as he is. For the man who is not awakened, the idea that anything in the universe could be eternal is unbearable, even if this were the universe itself. Our present day scientists abide by the same rule and say the universe must measure so many kilometers and must be so many millions of years old. Whether in space or in time, we can only measure the part of the universe that we can sense.</p>
<p>Everything is eternal, be it in the form of matter or energy, and we ourselves are composed of eternal matter.</p>
<p>The Elohim were created by people from another planet, who had been created by other people coming from another planet, and so on to
Infinity.</p>
<p>It is as foolish to search for the beginning of the universe in time as it is to search for the beginning of space.</p>
<p>Let us get back to the example where intelligent beings are living on the particle of one of the atoms of our hand and for whom this particle is a planet. In relation to space, the scientists on this microscopic planet located, for example, in the middle of the bone marrow of the first phalanx of our right index finger, these scientists will at first claim that the other particles that they can observe with the naked eye revolve around the centre of their world, their planet, the particle on which they are located. For these scientists, it is obvious that their planet is the centre of the universe. But they will progress, and one day a genius will prove that their sun does not revolve around their planet, and that the stars also do not revolve around their little world, but rather it is their planet that turns on itself in a near motionless sky, as well as turning around their sun at the same time. He will probably be burnt for his heretical theories by the inquisitorial witch-hunters of their &quot;particle planet&quot;, but a day will come when people, having discovered more sophisticated instruments of observation, will prove that he was right.</p>
<p>Then the learned scientists of that period will proceed to measure the universe, in all modesty, saying that it stretches from the farthest star particle located at one end of the sky to the farthest star particle located at the other end. This measurement will represent only one billionth of a billionth of the area of our finger where they happen to be located. But, since they cannot see any further, they will assume that the universe stops where they can no longer observe.</p>
<p>But the observation techniques will progress even more, and they will start to perceive that there are other galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Be that as it may, it will prove only that the universe is greater than had been anticipated, and it will always measure so many thousand kilometers or light-years, a little more than before, 10 or 100 times more eventually, nevertheless, it will always measure something.
We have reached this point in our progression on Earth.</p>
<p>But let us get back to the planet located on our finger.</p>
<p>Science is always progressing, and the inhabitants of our phalanx are now at the level to launch always more audacious space explorations. They finally reach a new frontier, the bone of which their planet is but an atom of an atom. This way they can be sure that the universe measures so much by so much. The proof is that, after that point, there is nothing more to be observed.</p>
<p>A little later they succeed in crossing the immensity which separates the bone from the muscle, and their universe gains new dimensions again.</p>
<p>They improve their space-ships and finally reach the layer of skin which covers our finger. They have reached the end of their universe, which measures one-and-a-half centimeters by our scale, but was many light-years for them.</p>
<p>They will still be able, however, to pursue their space explorations inside the rest of our body. They will follow certain currents where the stars are moving mysteriously at very high speeds - gigantic corridors, which they will chart to permit them to come and go freely from their planet, but little will they know that they are travelling in our blood vessels. Their universe will be measured, demarcated. It will have a particular height, width and depth. An incredible number of light-years on their scale but only 1.75 meters for us. They will not yet have discovered that our feet, for example, are standing on a planet which for them is itself made up of a great number of galaxies, which their narrow minds, always wanting to place frontiers everywhere, cannot even begin to imagine and grasp. For the quantity of atoms contained within the Earth is immeasurable compared with the number within our body.</p>
<p>They would also have to become conscious that there are other &quot;universe-men&quot; like us, who are walking on this planet, and that in our sky there are other stars and other galaxies, and so on to Infinity.</p>
<p>Only some of the wisest of them, having reached a superior level of consciousness allowing them to be in tune with the universe, will thus be able to teach all this to their disciples at a time where, for the official scientists, their universe measured only a millionth of a millionth of a millimeter of the bone of our finger, which they could observe, only from the inside...</p>
<p>The concept of Infinity in time is the very same thing. The scientists of that mini-world could measure the age of their universe by measuring the age of the molecule of which their planet is but an atom of an atom, and the universe would have that age. Then they would realize that the age of the cell of which the molecule that they thought to be the &quot;total universe&quot;, while it was, in fact, only a part, is much greater. Then they would discover that the limb, of which this cell is but a part, is much older still, and that the age of the being of which this member is but a part, is even greater, and so on to infinity. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-life"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-purpose-of-life">What is the Purpose of Life?</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>What is the purpose of life?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>As stated in the messages, everything must be estimated in relation to four levels. Our life means nothing when compared with the Infinite. If we die, if all of humanity disappears, it will not change anything in the Infinity of time or space. The gigantic being of whom we are a parasite of a particle of an atom, will continue to exist without noticing anything, and the whole of the history of mankind since its creation will have only lasted a billionth of a second for him.</p>
<p>The living beings on the atoms of the atoms of our hand will continue to exist as if nothing had happened, even if the atom on which their universe is located, is buried deep in the Earth in the flow of blood coming from our finger torn away by an explosion, for example. Even if this drop of blood is swallowed by a worm that retains the atom in which their universe is located, to constitute new cells for its growth, this will not affect the living beings on this little world, any more than it would affect the beings living on the atoms which make up the cells of their own fingers...</p>
<p>In relation to the Elohim, our life is very important, because we are their children, and we must show them that we are proud of having been privileged enough to have been created in their image. That is to say, able to become conscious of the Infinite, and also one day able to
create people in our own image in return.</p>
<p>In relation to human society, our life is equally very important, because we are the result of a long list of survivors who have escaped the epidemics and wars which have made us the offspring of a long natural selection. We owe it to ourselves to participate actively in the plan that will allow humanity to reach the Golden Age, which it greatly deserves and which it is about to enter. We are the cells of this huge being that is Humanity, and at the time of the birth of this humanity, each cell, each one of us is very important, in that he or she has a role to play.</p>
<p>Finally, in relation to our own self, our life has only the importance that we give it. If we recognize the Elohim as our creators, and if we wish to contribute to the diffusion of the messages, so that they will be known all over the Earth so that mankind enters the Golden Age, and if we enjoy our participation in this gigantic endeavor, then we are enjoying life for that reason.</p>
<p>The question was, 'what is the purpose of life?' Life was made to be enjoyed, whether you find pleasure in the diffusion of the messages of our creators, or pleasure in contributing to the entry of Humanity into the Golden Age, or pleasure in pleasing yourself by putting yourself in tune with the Infinite, or by any other means.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-pleasure"><a class="header" href="#what-is-pleasure">What is Pleasure?</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>What is pleasure?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>Pleasure is the reaction of an organism which has accomplished an act producing pleasant chemical reactions.</p>
<p>A baby experiences pleasure while suckling its mother's breast because its hunger is appeased, and because the chemical reaction produced by the milk on the papilla of the tongue produces a pleasant sensation. All our senses are there to give us pleasure, and <em>Sensual Meditation</em> is based on an improvement of the perception of pleasure provoked by the chemical reactions transmitted by our senses.</p>
<p>Everything we do during our life, we do because it gives us pleasure. There is not one action performed during our entire life which is not done for pleasure. The person who pays his income tax does it because it pleases him not to have to go to jail for not having paid it. The woman who throws herself under the wheels of a car to save her child, does it because it pleases her to see her child survive, even if it means being wounded in the process. And the soldier who throws himself under enemy fire in order to save his battalion, does so because it pleases him to die for his comrades. The suicide pilots of Japan are the ultimate example of this type of heroism -- pleasure.</p>
<p>There is a difference between direct pleasures, such as immediate sensual satisfaction, and indirect pleasures, such as the choice of behavior, which we spoke of earlier, and which are a reaction to exterior interventions without resulting in a conscious development of
our means of perception of the environment.</p>
<p>It is only when conscious pleasure is obtained in solitude in an attempt to improve the quality of one's perception, that true blossoming can take place. We are linked to the Infinite through our senses. Someone who cannot see, hear, smell, touch, or taste, would actually be dead, even if his heart was still beating. He would not be conscious of his environment and would therefore possess no intelligence.</p>
<p>It is important to note that those who are deprived of one sense develop the remaining senses to a much greater extent than people with all their senses. Blind people, for example, develop an acute sense of hearing that we cannot grasp, or can read with their finger-tips.</p>
<p>Scientific experiments have demonstrated that the pleasure centre is located within the brain. This was discovered by placing electrodes in that part of the brain and sending small electrical discharges. The people who were experimented on felt something which was close to an orgasm, the satisfaction of having made a new discovery and the feeling of being honorably quoted in public all in one go. It was then proven by complementary measures that it was this same pleasure centre which was activated, when one was reaching sexual orgasm, or when discovering something, or when an artist had finished a masterpiece, or when a soldier received a medal.</p>
<p>Better still, another experiment demonstrated that artists who were sexually aroused while creating noticed an increase in their potential of creativity.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more logical. Pleasure increases the potential of creativity, because it stimulates all our senses, and a creator must be linked to Infinity in order to have a harmonious masterpiece born.</p>
<p>We must then strive towards improving the quality of our perception of pleasure by increasing the sensitivity of all our senses.</p>
<p>As a direct result, other than the increased enjoyment, this increase in sensitivity will develop our total potential of creativity so that the rest of humanity may benefit from our creations, thus improving the general level of consciousness.</p>
<p>This is what is being taught at the courses of awakening that we organize for the Raelians.</p>
<p>By improving the level of individual consciousness, we improve the level of consciousness of Humanity, and so increase the chances of entering the Golden Age.</p>
<p>In order to change society, we must first change the individuals of which it is composed. Violence is always produced by those who are
unhappy.</p>
<p>By improving the individual's happiness, we help to lessen the potential for violence. Moreover and quite often, violence is produced by individuals who believe that they are unhappy, and the art of politicians is to strengthen this belief so as to overthrow those in power, to take their place. Then the former use the same tactics to reach the same goals, thus maintaining a feeling of dissatisfaction, which could one day, through the amplification of successive overthrows, result in the general feeling that the cause of the dissatisfaction is in another country. This is how wars are started.</p>
<p>If each individual becomes conscious of the Infinite, by developing his own sensuality, then the whole of society will be transformed.</p>
<p>This will start by the awakening of the consciousness of people more developed than others, who once they have attained a certain level, will become Guides for the people around them, and will allow others to become fully awakened, who will in turn awaken others, and so on. Thus gradually, the level of consciousness of Humanity will be raised to such a point that a fatal world conflict would become impossible.</p>
<p>The process has already started, and thousands of small, non-violent manifestations have taken place around the world, organized by students or intellectuals in favor of peace, of unilateral disarmament of such-or-such a country, and it is amplified by television, the central
nervous system of Humanity.</p>
<p>Each individual contributes at each moment of his life to the awakening or the stifling of planetary consciousness. You must not be afraid to influence others, as we are here for that purpose. But we should direct all our efforts and every word that we say, at every moment, so that all we say and every action we do has a positive influence on the course of human history.</p>
<p>One must never seek to convince others, because people who perceive that we are trying to convince them, have a tendency to strengthen their position. Whereas, if one discovers a point in common with the other's philosophy, then one can concentrate on this common point, and from there, unveil a new path for our listener, so that he will have the impression of having found it out by himself.</p>
<p>It is foolish to say that we will not influence anyone else by stubbornly following our own way and letting others follow theirs.</p>
<p>The mere fact of not trying to influence others influences them even more than if one takes a fanatical stand on something. People fear fanaticism more and more, whatever the subject, and they are right to do so. This is in fact the beginning of wisdom.</p>
<p>On Earth, there are people who seek the truth and show it, and others who seek the truth and hide it, but there is not one single person who does not seek it. Then there are people who pretend that they have found the truth and show it, too often concerned with maintaining traditions, and last there are people who have found the real truth and show it: the Raelians.</p>
<p>We are very interested in those people who seek the truth and show it, because it shows that they are sincere and open-minded, generally very intelligent and relatively harmonious. In any case, for the most part, they are ready to accept a new vision of the world without fearing that this change will traumatize them to the point of unbalancing them. These people represent a great majority of present-day Raelians; they are the pioneers.</p>
<p>Those people who seek the truth and hide it, are also very important to us, but they will be more than likely to join us when they have overcome their self-consciousness, and no longer worry what other people think of them.</p>
<p>Those people who pretend that they have found the truth, and show it, will come to us when it becomes evident that nothing is constant in the universe, and therefore it is nonsense to try to preserve traditions that no longer mean anything. They just love their traditions but could not care less about what &quot;God&quot; really is.</p>
<p>All of these people do this for pleasure. The latter get pleasure in thinking that their children will pray in exactly the same way as they have, and that their children will teach their own children the very same ways of praying, even though school will teach them that man is descended from the monkey. So what if it is wrong? What is important to them is for the teaching at school to be respected, yet also for what the priest says to be respected. The fact that they are both contradictory is neither here nor there, what is important is that they are both traditions, and according to these lovers of tradition, it is not up to us to question which one is right.</p>
<p>Christians would surely crucify Jesus a second time if he himself were to ask them not to go to church on Sunday, or not to baptize their children before they had reached adulthood. This is the position adopted by the worshippers of tradition.</p>
<p>Those people who seek the truth and hide it, feel pleasure in thinking that what people think they are is more important than what they truly are. Those people would not crucify Jesus, they would even be against it, but they would still not intervene or even say anything. They do not want to get involved in anything, not even if it means defending what they believe to be the truth.</p>
<p>When all of Humanity enjoys its sensuality to the full, the risk of a world conflict will have disappeared. At the root of all violence, there are always sensually dissatisfied people. This is why we must learn to enjoy all of our senses, and help everyone around us to discover their total sensuality, starting with children. It is not sufficient to show them &quot;how it works&quot;, like sexual education tends to do, but we must teach them &quot;how to use it&quot; so as to obtain and give more pleasure.</p>
<p>Sexual education should be replaced by sensual education.</p>
<p>Pleasure is always fulfilling, direct pleasure that is, and not the pleasure of the soldier who dies for his comrades. Direct pleasure develops in each individual the means to become in tune with the Infinite, and really feel a part of the Infinite.</p>
<p>Our body is nothing more than an accumulation of atoms organized according to a master plan, the genetic code, which interacts with the environment through an infinity of chemical reactions of which we are not always aware. Raising our level of consciousness corresponds to feeling an even greater number of these chemical reactions, so as to better situate ourselves in the Infinite, and so as to become more harmonious. When we feel linked to the universe, eternal and Infinite, we can never be unhappy, because we have then discovered the pleasure of being.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-death"><a class="header" href="#what-is-death">What is Death?</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>What is death?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>Death in relation to the Infinite means nothing. The matter of which we are composed is eternal. Therefore, we are made of eternity.</p>
<p>The infinitely small particles which compose our nose existed before they became part of us. Some of these particles were contained in the steak that our mother ate while we were in the womb, and those particles passed through her body and became part of our face. Other particles were in the fruit that we ate yesterday, they came into our abdomen and then travelled through our bloodstream to land on our nose. This is true for every part of our body. After death, the reaction will be exactly the same. The particles will return to the Earth to be recycled, and some particles will land in animals, others in plants, but most of them will remain in the Earth 'for you are dust and you will return to dust.'</p>
<p>Death, however, is the final cataclysm for the mass formed by this accumulation of organized matter, which makes up what we are.</p>
<p>Death is the beginning of the process of dispersion of the matter of which we are composed.</p>
<p>But to understand death, one must truly understand what life is all about. Life is nothing other than the organization of the unorganized.</p>
<p>The Elohim came on Earth at a time when life did not exist. There existed only unorganized matter at our level - what we call the biological level.</p>
<p>They took this matter, they &quot;kneaded&quot; it, as stated in <em>The Bible,</em> and they &quot;shaped&quot; it to create living beings. This was all done at the molecular level, but for primitive man, this was impossible to understand, so they related it to pottery. They believed that the creators took a little piece of clay and created Man like you would do a flower pot. It is true that the creators did take chemical components from the Earth, but they combined them scientifically in such a way that the inanimate became animated.</p>
<p>Every living thing on Earth has been created by the Elohim, starting from a basic &quot;brick&quot;, a molecular structure composed of atoms judiciously assembled. Our scientists are starting to discover that all living things, animal or vegetable, man or beast, have similar basic components. It's like a sort of alphabet, where every letter is an atom which makes up the genetic code of each living species. The order in which the letters are placed may differ with each species, but the letters of the alphabet would always remain the same. So with one relatively simple &quot;brick&quot;, our creators were able to make an enormous quantity of &quot;houses&quot; that differed in their appearance, but which were all identical in their basic components. When the species reproduce, they are doing no more than &quot;reproducing&quot; the genetic code of the first model of their species.</p>
<p>So then, life is the organization of the unorganized, and death is disorganization of the organized.</p>
<p>Life is like a house that would build itself, by itself, starting from its own plan, and furthermore, it would maintain itself automatically.</p>
<p>Death is the end of this automatic maintenance and the beginning of the dispersion of the basic materials of which the house is made, finally ending in the destruction of the plan which it had contained.</p>
<p>The Great Architects of our universe who have designed the plans of these &quot;houses&quot; designed a type which would be capable one day of matching its creators and becoming architects themselves, by creating other plans able to build &quot;houses&quot; which build themselves, by themselves. This type of superior &quot;house&quot; is Man, who will soon be able to create new synthetic genetic codes, new plans, starting from inanimate matter.</p>
<p>The living being was created with the ability of situating himself in his own environment through his &quot;perception feelers&quot;, his senses.</p>
<p>Humans are nothing more than self-programming, self- reproducing biological computers.</p>
<p>There is no difference between humans and highly sophisticated biological computers, such as those we are now able to produce, only our computers are far more perfected and can perform far more accurately than a human.</p>
<p>The computers can be equipped with means enabling them to situate themselves in their own environment. Recently, a computer was equipped with wheels enabling it to move by itself around obstacles, thanks to TV cameras wired to its &quot;brain&quot;. It can &quot;see&quot; exactly as we can with our eyes, and it can move in its environment.</p>
<p>A computer only does what it has been programmed for, and so does Man; but let us continue our comparison between Man and the computer.</p>
<p>As far as hearing is concerned, it is easy to endow a computer with a microphone that will pick up noise as we do with our ears.</p>
<p>It is also possible to give it an analyzer, which will identify the perfumes that surround it, just as we do with our nose.</p>
<p>Then it is also possible to give it a taste analyzer that would indicate the taste of various substances as we do with our mouth.</p>
<p>Finally, it is possible to equip the computer with feelers capable of functions that we perform with our hands, such as measuring temperature, hardness and weight.</p>
<p>Better still, the computer can be equipped with &quot;organs&quot; infinitely superior to our human organs. Let us take sight, for example. The cameras used on the computer can be equipped with multiple lenses, including a zoom lens, which will enable it to see clearly what is going on many kilometers away, or a microscopic object; things that the human eye is unable to see unless equipped with artificial prostheses such as binoculars or microscopes.</p>
<p>The same thing applies to the sense of hearing. While we can only perceive the sounds that exist around us in a very narrow range, certain animals, like dogs, can perceive a wider range. So our computer can be equipped with receptors sensitive to ultra-sounds or infra-sounds and directional microphones allowing it to hear sounds that are many kilometers away at a precise location.</p>
<p>Getting back to sight, the cameras could be equipped to pick up ultraviolet or infrared rays enabling it to see at night, something we are not capable of doing with our limited vision.</p>
<p>And as for the sense of smell, the odor analyzer could identify odors and instantly transmit the chemical composition of the perfumes or surrounding gases, something which our nose could never do.</p>
<p>For the sense of taste, we could also equip it with flavor analyzers capable of making a detailed chemical analysis of any given substance.</p>
<p>Finally, for the sense of touch, we could give it feelers, a touch mechanism able to analyze with precision the temperature, the weight and the hardness of objects or substances, other than saying it's hot or it's heavy. It would also be able to manipulate things at temperatures that our skin could not endure, things weighing a thousand times more than our poor human muscles could lift.</p>
<p>We could go even further and equip our computer with senses that man does not possess or that he is unable to make use of. We could, for example, give it radar, permitting it to move in complete darkness, a sonar, an x-ray detector, a compass, a gravity detector, a radio communication system, so many senses that our body is not provided with, and that we cannot even perceive, except with the use of electronic prosthesis that we can rarely have altogether in the same place and at any given time.</p>
<p>Let us compare the energy requirements of the human computer and the machine. When a man needs energy, he says, 'I am hungry', looks for food and eats it. Scientists have recently completed a computer equipped with electrical batteries. It works, and its cameras enable it to move and to store and move about heavy boxes just like a fork-lift truck. Suddenly, the battery charge becomes too weak, and it loses its efficiency. Its energy indicator shows that the time has come to charge the batteries. Then, by itself, it will move to an electrical outlet, plug itself in, and wait patiently until the charge is sufficient, then disconnect itself and return to work. This is no different from the man who says 'I am hungry' and proceeds to the cafeteria to get food at mealtimes and then returns to work.</p>
<p>What happens when a man is injured? He stops working, he gets medical attention, then returns to work. A computer can be programmed for self-maintenance, just as it was programmed to feed itself. If one of its parts becomes defective, it will go to a workshop, remove the part and replace it with a new one, and this is done without human help. This computer will then become eternal and will never be faced, as man is, with the issue of death.</p>
<p>Man is able to reproduce himself, and so is the computer. It only needs to be programmed accordingly. If a computer is programmed to make replicas of itself, which have the ability to do the very same thing, then in a very short time, we will have an overgrowing population of computers. This is why they must not be programmed to reproduce; for humans, this is called the species conservation instinct, the unconscious desire to reproduce. Humans find pleasure in copulating, unaware that they are in fact responding to an impulse, the species conservation instinct. If there was no pleasure in copulating, then there would be no reproduction. The human genetic code was programmed so that pleasure is obtained through copulation, in order for reproduction to take place. The humans who use a contraceptive method, such as the pill, the cap or the condom, etc., make a fantastic &quot;nose-thumbing&quot; to their genetic code. They consciously take pleasure without it leading to reproduction. Pleasure always brings an expansion of the mind, but overpopulation is certainly a serious danger for Humanity; contraception is a magnificent way that humans have of showing that they are conscious of themselves and conscious of the importance of their actions in regard to the whole of humanity.</p>
<p>Let us get back to our computer; it could also be programmed to feel pleasure in doing certain things. Every computer which performs as it has been programmed to perform, experiences pleasure from its performance. When the computer &quot;feels&quot; that its energy level is low, it says, 'this is wrong', then runs over to recharge. When it feels the new energy running through its circuits, it can say 'this is good' and in
doing so 'feels pleasure'.</p>
<p>What goes into the program of a computer? Information contained in a memory bank that will rule the behavior of the computer. If it is programmed to calculate, it will calculate; if it is programmed to draw, it will draw; if is programmed to play music, it will play music.</p>
<p>But it will not play music if it has been programmed to calculate and vice versa, unless of course it has been programmed for both functions.</p>
<p>How is a human programmed? On the one hand, there is the genetic code, which is filled with information related to his behavior, to his sensual means, which enable him to communicate with his environment, to his physical means so that he can move, feed himself, reproduce, etc. This is what each human receives at birth (more or less in relation to his heredity), and which constitutes the innate. On the other hand, his education will provide him with a language so that he can communicate with his fellow humans, laws which will regulate his behavior, a set of &quot;moral values&quot;, a teaching, a concept of the world, a religion, etc. All these things will determine the individual's behavior. The individual will be under the impression that he is performing on his own, of living in a world where his values are those which he has chosen, but they will be only those which his education has imposed upon him, those ideas received from people who have played the role of educator or programmer. This is called experience.</p>
<p>Ordinary people, unconscious people, are incapable of doing anything other than that which they have been programmed for by their genetics or by their experience, by their heredity and by their educators. The &quot;total man&quot;, the man who raises his level of consciousness so as to situate himself in the infinity of space and time, becomes a self-programmable computer. He can question the program which has been imposed on him by his education without asking advice, and replace his total or partial education with a new and more appropriate set of values that will seem better, in relation to higher standards, than those antiquated ones which had motivated his family and his environment. Those standards were aimed generally at conditioning him to keep alive the traditions of the past, of times when men were totally primitive, with a low level of consciousness in their conception of the world, and the role that humans had been created to play in it.</p>
<p>An ordinary man who wishes to become a &quot;total man&quot;, a man with a higher level of consciousness which would enable him to exploit a little more than 10 per cent of his brain -- percentage used by ordinary men and partial men -- must be able to do his own in-depth &quot;brain-washing&quot;. This operation will enable him to look at everything in his brain, to put back what seems to be good and to disregard what seems to be bad. He will keep his own ideas and get rid of the ones he received either from other people, his family, or his environment, ideas which he has received from those people who wanted to model him after their own conventions and for their own convenience. This applies to his behavior, his reactions to world events, the way he awakens, gets up, gets dressed, works, speaks to others and listens to them, the blossoming of his sexual life, etc. - everything, each gesture, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem. A total man is conscious of each movement of his eyebrows and the effect it could have on the people surrounding him.</p>
<p>Quite obviously, this great &quot;spring cleaning&quot; in order to be efficient, must be done in the company of someone who has already crossed the line which separates &quot;ordinary men&quot; from the infinite universe of &quot;total man&quot;, someone who knows all the different paths, and who is able to lead this new traveller in the proper direction, and to guide without forcing him, letting him choose his own path freely.</p>
<p>A man's consciousness is a house which has been built usually by other people, based on standards which have never been questioned, since the same thing had been done to them and to their parents before them. The total man will destroy this house and build a new one, adapted to his taste, and to his imagination. He will recover from the old ruins certain things which seem reusable, and combining them with the new components, he will build a new house, perfectly suitable to his new personality. Men have houses built in conformity to their level of consciousness. Houses have always been square or rectangular, with slanted roof tops, and nothing could change that. They keep building the same type of house over and over again. Every house is like a Greek temple with vertical walls, like pillars, and a slanted rooftop, like a pyramid sitting on top of the Greek pillars. Modern construction techniques allow for more personalization when building a house. For instance, it could be completely round, it could have the shape of a ball, or an egg, or an Egyptian pyramid, or a bird, or a tree, etc. Houses which are built in series all looking exactly the same and forming morbid looking uniform villages, are the exact reflection of the level of consciousness of their inhabitants. And yet paradoxically, the house is a typical example of Man's capacity for self-programming. The blackbird has always built his nest in the same way, and it cannot change that because this is programmed into its genetic code. Man, however, is capable of adapting his shelter to his environment. He can build Greek temples, pyramids, huts, igloos, wooden cottages, skyscrapers made of iron and cement, cathedrals made of stone, and towers made of metal or glass.</p>
<p>The mere fact that Man is a self-programming computer does not make him different from the machine. All computers can be programmed to do the same as we do, and like us, they could be programmed to reproduce themselves. It could be also possible to program a computer so that it could be self-programming. It would be able to live, to work, to reproduce itself from a basic program, based on its experiences, and to give this information to its descendants, to the computers that it would reproduce.</p>
<p>We could even imagine a &quot;mind expanding&quot; computer which would have the ability to awaken the programs of already existing computers which had been created as non self-programming, so that this feature would be transmitted to them...</p>
<p>Man is therefore starting to discover, through the machine, that there is nothing mysterious about himself nor his origins, nor his behavior. Everything that a man can do, a computer can do, and what is more, it can do it much better. This applies to everything that can be done by a human, and it includes artistic creativity. There are computers capable of composing music, of drawing and so on.</p>
<p>We could never find a human ability that cannot be programmed in a computer, even getting in tune with the Infinite could be programmed. All of this is simply fantastic, and Man is able to look upon himself as a wonderful machine and concentrate whole-heartedly on seeking happiness and total blossoming through the fulfillment of his own needs and that of his fellow men, in order to build a world in which all men will be happy to feel that they are infinite and eternal.</p>
<h2 id="sexual-freedom-and-no-obligation"><a class="header" href="#sexual-freedom-and-no-obligation">Sexual Freedom and No Obligation</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The message mentioned total sexual freedom. But for a couple who read the books and wish to become Raelians, does it become mandatory to practice the exchange of partners?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>Freedom to do something and obligation are two different things, which must not be confused. A Raelian couple who love each other deeply, where both partners do not wish to share a sexual experience with other couples, should stay together. If they feel happy being with each other without the need to experience anything else, that is just fine. Everyone must do as he or she pleases. Sexual freedom of choosing a single partner, once you have discovered who you really are, and once you have discovered a partner who fills your every need and whose every need you seem to fill, becomes a question of choice to live together. However, quite often an experience with another person will render you more appreciative of your partner's company, as you become more conscious of his or her qualities. In so far as sexual contacts are concerned, everything is possible, everything is permitted. I must insist on the word permitted for it does not mean mandatory.</p>
<p>Since the creation of the Raelian Movement, I have had the opportunity to see many couples start new relationships. Some of these seem to be so successful that I can very well see what they hope to gain in seeing other partners. Perhaps these experiences would only confirm that they are truly made for each other. Some people are sufficiently awakened to understand that the experience in itself is not really necessary. When a man is totally conscious, he does not need to do something to find out what the result is going to be, he knows it, he can feel it, unless the experience is aimed at the awakening of a disciple, or it is felt essential to his own personal progression. Each person is free to follow his own chosen path so long as the following three fundamental rules are observed:</p>
<p>Respect the tastes and decisions of others in the free choice of their partners; be permanently conscious that others do not belong to us and that nobody can be the owner of anybody; and always seek above anything else, the happiness of those we claim to love.</p>
<p>On this basis, everything is possible, couples, threesomes, foursomes and &quot;more-somes&quot; of Raelians living a perfect happiness, whether they be homosexuals, heterosexuals, or bisexuals.</p>
<h2 id="raelism-and-homosexuality"><a class="header" href="#raelism-and-homosexuality">Raelism and Homosexuality</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>What is the position of the Raelian Movement on homosexuality?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>It is quite simple: each individual has the right to do with his or her body as he or she sees fit. Homosexuality is not a normal or abnormal mode of behavior. Each person must live an harmonious sexual life corresponding to tastes and natural tendencies. In the mother's womb the sexual differentiation is felt at a very late stage of development. There are very masculine men, and men who are more feminine, just as there are women who are virile and others who are very feminine, with all the possible and imaginable shades in between.</p>
<p>It is foolish to condemn a homosexual because he is a homosexual, just as it would be foolish to condemn a man because he is a man, or a cat because it is a cat, as all of this is genetic. Many types of animals are homosexual, and in the country one can see frequently, dogs, cattle, and chickens indulging in homosexual behavior.</p>
<p>Homosexuality is as natural as a dog or a hen is natural.</p>
<p>What is not natural is the wish to obligate others to have the same sexuality as oneself. It is generally what those who torture people who do not resemble them are doing. They are generally the same as those who are racist, traditionalist and militarist.</p>
<p>The aggression aimed at homosexual people is a form of racism. It usually comes from people who lead a miserable sex life, and cannot tolerate that others could blossom while living something else.</p>
<p>These same people who condemn homosexuality will forgive very easily a man charged with raping a woman, even though it is an abominable crime. Among the Raelian Guides there are male and female homosexuals, there are heterosexuals and bisexuals. All of them are blossoming because they are conscious of being loved as they are with the opportunity to fulfill themselves living in their body as they please, in a fraternal communion of thought that no other religion is able to give them. How can one still be a Roman Catholic follower when one hears the &quot;Vatican Usurper&quot; condemn homosexuality while depriving women of their rights of becoming priests. These are two proofs of racism and sexism that can help those who have eyes to see the truth.</p>
<h2 id="deists-and-evolutionists-the-false-prophets"><a class="header" href="#deists-and-evolutionists-the-false-prophets">Deists and Evolutionists: The False Prophets</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>It is written, 'When the age of the Apocalypse will arrive, there will be many false prophets.' Who are they?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>There are many false prophets in our day and age. Do not forget the meaning of the word <em>prophet</em>, its etymology. It means &quot;the one who reveals&quot;, as we have stated earlier. The false prophets of our time, that is to say, those who reveal or teach false information, are all those people who try to bring humanity back to primitive beliefs in an immaterial and impalpable, yet almighty &quot;God&quot; who watches over each human being to either punish or reward him, as the case may be.</p>
<p>It is a concept which mixes the infinite, which is indeed impalpable in its totality because of it being infinite in space and eternal in
time - yet without any consciousness of its own and thus with no power over humanity as a whole, nor over any single person, for that matter -- and the Elohim who are our creators, who are real and almighty in this sector of the infinite, but who love us, their children, and who allow us to evolve freely in our scientific and spiritual progression.</p>
<p>The second category of contemporary false prophets are all those people, scientists or not, who claim that life on Earth, and therefore Humanity, is the result of successive random chance events, which all happened during what they call &quot;evolution&quot;. As Einstein said, there cannot be a watch without a watchmaker. All those people who believe that we came from the monkey through a slow evolutionary process, believe that the beautiful watch which we are, has built itself by accident. It is a bit like saying that if we put all the components of a watch together in a bag and shook it around for a while, we would eventually get a perfect working watch. Try a billion times if you so desire...</p>
<p>The evolutionists are also false prophets, false informers, people who lead the majority of the population away from the truth about our creators, the Elohim. This population, which easily swallows and dumbly believes in everything said by these narrow-minded high priests in white coats - who compose the majority of the scientific community - is purposely kept ignorant and so inevitably believes that which officialdom says is true. Can you begin to imagine what the Elohim feel when they see that humans attribute their masterpiece to random chance?</p>
<h2 id="suicide"><a class="header" href="#suicide">Suicide</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>It is said in the second message that one who suffers too much pain has the right to commit suicide. Does it mean that suicide is a good thing?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>We will all be judged according to our actions while living on this Earth. The person with more positive than negative actions will be entitled to eternal life on the planet of the Elohim. If a person suffers too much physically, and if human science is unable to relieve his pain, then he has a right to put an end to his life. If most of his actions in his life were positive, he will be re-created to live eternally.</p>
<p>If they were mainly negative, he will not be re-created, and for him there will be nothing. However, if most of his actions were negative, he could be re-created to be judged later by those same people whom he made to suffer.</p>
<p>Someone who is not physically suffering, or who has no handicap, must not commit suicide, as we all have a mission to accomplish on this Earth, especially Raelians. They must dedicate their lives to the diffusion of the messages given by the Elohim, of whom they are the spokes-people. To end one's life is like an act of treason, it's like running from one's post during combat. I am referring to the combat which will awaken humanity and allow it to survive in order to reach the Golden Age. The Elohim are counting on each one of us, and each Raelian is very precious to our creators.</p>
<p>Allow me to repeat myself: the only time when suicide is acceptable is when a person is in extreme physical pain, which cannot be relieved by science, or when his faculties have diminished to the point where he can no longer act effectively.</p>
<p>All other people are messengers of our Fathers who are in the sky, and we must all dedicate our lives to the spreading of the good news.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-new-revelations"><a class="header" href="#the-new-revelations">The New Revelations</a></h1>
<p>This chapter contains revelations that the Elohim had asked Rael to keep secret until three years after his journey when the second message was revealed to him. Now that we are in the year 34 (1979), these things can be known to all.</p>
<h2 id="the-devil-does-not-exist-i-met-him"><a class="header" href="#the-devil-does-not-exist-i-met-him">The Devil Does Not Exist, I Met Him</a></h2>
<p>Do not tremble when wondering if a creature with horns, with cloven feet, well hidden, waits for the right moment to come and prick your backside with a trident. Since there is no ‚ÄúGod‚Äù sitting on a white cloud, holding a flash of lightning in his right hand, the devil does not exist either.</p>
<p>For the average person, Devil, Satan, Lucifer or Demon are different names attributed to a single person who is one and the same, and personifies the forces of evil, just as they would think of ‚ÄúApocalypse‚Äù as meaning ‚Äúthe end of the world‚Äù.</p>
<p>Let us trace the true meaning of these words. Satan is chronologically the most ancient. When the Elohim created the first completely synthetic living beings in the laboratories on their original planet, a certain group of people from their world protested against these genetic manipulations, which they thought were dangerous for their civilization. They were afraid that one day the scientists would create monsters that would escape from the laboratories and would commit murders within the population. Unfortunately, we know that this is what happened, and the movement that was trying to have this genetic engineering work forbidden, triumphed. So the government of the planet of the Elohim ordered the scientists to halt their experiments and forced them to destroy all their works.</p>
<p>The group which led the battle against these genetic manipulations was presided by an Eloha called Satan.</p>
<p>The scientists were finally permitted to go to another planet and pursue their experiments. A description of this event is described in Matthew 13:3-4. It is a parable which describes the works of the creation of life on other planets by the Elohim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A sower went forth to sow; and when he sowed, some seeds fell by the
way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The birds are the messengers sent by Satan, who thought that the planet chosen for their creation of life experiments was far too close to their own, and that if by chance the beings created in a laboratory were in fact more intelligent than their creators, and became violent, they could prove to be dangerous for the population of the Elohim‚Äôs planet. The government gave them permission to once again destroy the works of the scientists.</p>
<p>They had to search for another planet which lent itself to the creation of life, but they failed twice. The first time, the chosen planet was too close to a star, and the creation was burnt by the harmful rays coming from that star, and on the second one, they were invaded by the vegetation. Finally, they reached a planet which offered all the necessary elements so that their creation could survive, and it was located far enough away so as not to show any signs of danger in the eyes of the association presided over by Satan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: but other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p>Matthew 13: 5-9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We know the Elohim also created life on two other planets at that time, hence the allusion to ‚Äúthree harvests‚Äù.</p>
<p>We also know that the permission which allowed the scientists to come to Earth to create life was granted to them on the sole condition that they did not create people in their image. The first message explains how they overruled this order and also shows the reaction of their government, which strictly forbade them to reveal to the first terrestrial men, whom they had fabricated, how they had been created and who they were, and demanded that these first men be obligated to fear their creators, by asking the creators to show themselves as supernatural beings, divine beings in some way.</p>
<p>Satan thought that one could not expect anything good from these scientifically created creatures, and that out of Man only evil could come.</p>
<p>So we understand perfectly that Satan was just one of the Elohim, leading, in some way, a political party on the planet, that was opposed to the creation of artificial beings in their image by other Elohim who themselves thought that they could create positive and non-violent beings.</p>
<p>Then came Lucifer, which means ‚Äúlight bearer‚Äù. Lucifer is one of the Elohim who created life on Earth, thus created Man.</p>
<p>Lucifer was heading a small group of scientists working in one of the genetic engineering laboratories which studied the behavior of the first ynthetic men. Noticing the extraordinary aptitudes exhibited by their creation, Lucifer decided to overrule the order and reveal to these first humans that those whom they had mistaken for ‚ÄúGods‚Äù where in fact men like themselves, made of flesh and blood, and who came from another planet in flying machines made of palpable material. Lucifer, and the Elohim who followed him, felt love and affection for their synthetically created humans. They started to love these beings as their own children - these beings that they studied all day long, who were obliged to look upon them as &quot;Gods&quot;. </p>
<p>They could not bear to see their creatures, who seemed to be a physical and psychological success, and who were beautiful and intelligent, on their hands and knees adoring them as if they were idols, all of this just because the government of their planet of origin, of which Yahweh was the president, strictly forbade them from telling their creations the truth and forced the Elohim to play the role of supernatural beings permanently.</p>
<p>Lucifer, &quot;the bearer of light&quot;, enlightened the first men when he revealed that the creators were not &quot;Gods&quot; but men like themselves.</p>
<p>This attitude is directly opposed to that of Satan who thinks that only evil can be expected from men, and also to Yahweh, the president of the council of the Eternals governing the Elohim's planet.</p>
<p>So far, no creature with horns.</p>
<p>Yahweh condemns the scientists who had disobeyed his orders to spend the rest of their lives in exile on Earth. He condemns the  &quot;serpent&quot; to crawl on Earth, as it is so poetically written, and evicts Man from the laboratory, the &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; where they were fed and lodged without having to make the slightest effort.</p>
<p>But Satan doesn't give up over this, as what he wishes is that all the beings that have been created, be totally destroyed, because he judges them to be dangerous, due to their violence. As time passes, Satan accumulates proof of Man's aggression by observing the way in which humans kill each other with the weapons that are given to them by the sons of Lucifer's exiled group of Elohim. The latter is involved in</p>
<p>&quot;tender&quot; relations with the daughters of men who manage to receive weapons in exchange for their charms, under the false pretense of giving them to their fathers or brothers so that they can hunt for food. In fact, men choose to fight abominable battles among themselves with this arsenal.</p>
<p>Seeing the proofs of such a slaughter, brought by Satan before the Council of the Eternals, Yahweh decides to do what Satan asks, that is to say, totally destroy the life that has been created on Earth, and by the same token allow Lucifer's group to return to their own planet and be forgiven, thus putting an end to their exile.</p>
<p>But when Lucifer's group learns that their fabulous creation is soon to be destroyed, they decide that they cannot allow that. They still feel very strongly that among men there are some who are positive and non-violent, full of love and fraternity. Among these was Noah whom they helped build a space craft which would protect him from destruction, by staying in orbit around the earth. This craft contained a few men and women and the genetic codes of some animal species, which would be used to re-create them after the cataclysm.</p>
<p>It was only then that the Elohim discovered that they too had been created in the same manner that they had created man, scientifically, in a laboratory, by other people coming from another world. They then decided never again to destroy humanity, and helped Lucifer's group to re-implant the life forms preserved in the &quot;ark&quot;. Satan is still convinced of the evil in Man, but he bows before the majority of those who, behind Yahweh, think the contrary within the council of the Eternals. Yahweh understood, through the message contained in the unmanned spaceship coming from another planet which landed on their planet, that if men are violent they will &quot;self-destroy&quot; when they discover energies enabling them to enter an interplanetary level of civilization.</p>
<p>The Elohim decided to let men progress by themselves, but chose certain people, or had them born on Earth, who would be responsible for the creation of the religions, which were designed to keep traces of their work on Earth, so that the creators of Man would be recognized as such when the time came when mankind had  sufficiently evolved, scientifically, to be able to understand rationally.</p>
<p>Messages of such importance could be given only to trustworthy people, and first of all, the Elohim had to assure themselves that their chosen ones were faithful to their creators, so that they would not betray what was revealed to them. So Satan was given the responsibility of testing the prophets.</p>
<p>How are they going to test the faithfulness of these people? Once a person has been contacted by the messengers of the Elohim, telling him of his mission, Satan or one of his men would contact the prophet-to-be and by slander would destroy the Elohim in his mind, trying to get the human to abjure his fathers, or to accept to betray his mission on the promise of material advantages, for example. What is the word for slanderer in Greek? Simply <em>diablos</em>. Here is our famous devil, but he still has no horns, no hooves...</p>
<p>Jesus, for example, was taken into the desert for forty days for his initiation period, and was at certain times confronted with, &quot;the devil&quot; to see if he would deny his father:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of
the devil.</p>
<p>Matthew 4: 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, to be clearer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Jesus was taken to the desert to be tested by a slanderer.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The many tests imposed by &quot;the devil&quot; are also described. First of all, he asks Jesus to turn the stones into bread to prove he is the son of God:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.' But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.'</p>
<p><em>Matthew 4: 3-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus tells Satan that it is more important to be faithful to the Elohim than to eat. The devil is tempting him with food since Jesus has fasted for quite some time. Then Jesus is carried to the pinnacle of the temple and told to jump so that the &quot;angels of God&quot; will cushion his fall to prevent him from being injured:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and, On their hands they shall bear thee up, lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.' Jesus said unto him, 'Again it is written, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.'</p>
<p>Matthew 4: 6-7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus replies to the devil that he has not been placed on Earth for the useless exercise of testing his creators, thus proving that he does not ask for their help at every moment.</p>
<p>Then Satan leads Jesus to the top of a high mountain and proposes to make him a great and very rich king on the Earth.</p>
<p>Again, the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; and he said unto him, 'All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.' Then saith Jesus unto him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.' Then the devil leaveth him; and behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</p>
<p>Matthew 4: 8-11.*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus shows his loyalty to the Elohim whom he prefers to serve rather than become a powerful and rich man. It must be noted in these verses that Jesus refers to the slanderer by his name, since he calls him Satan. Since the test was successful, the &quot;angels&quot;, the Elohim's messengers, came down to Jesus to complete the initiation.</p>
<p>Jesus was not the only one to be tested by &quot;the devil&quot;; Job was also tested by Satan. The beginning of <em>The Book of Job</em> is quite eloquent, as it shows clearly what good relations, or even fraternal relations there were between Yahweh and Satan:</p>
<p>Now there was a day when the sons of Elohim came to present  themselves before Yahweh, and Satan came also among them.</p>
<p>And Yahweh said unto Satan, 'Whence comest thou?' Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, 'From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.' And Yahweh said unto</p>
<p>Satan, 'Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth Elohim, and escheweth evil?' Then Satan answered  Yahweh, and said, 'Doth Job fear Elohim for nought? Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.' And Yahweh said unto Satan, 'Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand.'</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh.</p>
<p>Job 1: 6-12.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see clearly that Yahweh is above Satan in the Elohim  hierarchy. But still he authorizes Satan, in his capacity of &quot;opposition party leader&quot;, to do as he pleases, by giving him Job, so to speak, so that he can prove that he can take a man who loves the Elohim profoundly, and bring him to hate them if he is afflicted by misfortunes, ruin or sickness.</p>
<p>In fact, Satan ruins Job totally, but the latter continues to love and show respect for the Elohim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, and said, 'Naked came  I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Yahweh gave, and Yahweh hath taken away; blessed be the name of Yahweh.' In all this Job sinned not, nor charged Elohim foolishly.</p>
<p><em>Job 1: 20-22.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Satan doesn't give up; he reports to the president of the Council of the Eternals:</p>
<p>Again there was a day when the sons of Elohim came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan came also among them to  present himself before Yahweh. And Yahweh said unto Satan,</p>
<p>'From whence comest thou?' And Satan answered Yahweh, and said, 'From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.' And Yahweh said unto Satan, 'Hast thou  considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth Elohim, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.'</p>
<p>And Satan answered Yahweh, and said, 'Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.' And Yahweh said unto Satan, 'Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life..' Job 2: 1-6.</p>
<p>Yahweh therefore allows Satan to ruin Job's health so as to see if he will always love his creators. And Job continues to respect the Elohim.</p>
<p>Only then he began to ask Yahweh why he had been brought into the world, if it was only to be afflicted with all kinds of misfortunes.</p>
<p>Finally, Yahweh intervenes and briefly explains to Job what has happened. Yahweh tells Job that he is wrong to judge his creators who ran the test, and to regret having been born. Yahweh restores Job's health, and even more possessions than he had before he was ruined. </p>
<p>At the end of the meeting I had with Yahweh on the relay vessel, he stepped out for a few moments, telling me that he would meet with me later. Then one of the other two Elohim asked me to follow him.</p>
<p>He took me to a small room, marvelously decorated. The walls were like the interior of a round pyramid, and those walls were covered with luminous sound waves which gave the impression of multicolored water waves. Everything was moving to a marvelously relaxing rhythm of musical vibrations. After having me seated in a comfortable chair which was covered with black fur, giving it the impression of being alive, he said:</p>
<p>'I must warn you that among the Elohim there is not only one opinion as to the future of Humanity on Earth. Yahweh thinks that men are good, and he feels that we should let them progress by themselves, convinced that if they are negative, they will self-destroy. </p>
<p>All my many followers and I, think that men are evil and that we should help mankind hasten its self-destruction. We propose that you help us accelerate the final cataclysm, which would only purify the universe of beings who are only the result of an unsuccessful experiment.</p>
<p>If you try to accomplish the mission given to you by Yahweh, you will always remain a poor man, and you will have to put up with the sarcasm of everyone. You will suffer, perhaps even be put in jail, or even worse, put to death by your own blood brothers. If you accept my offer, and carry out my plan based on increasing the various racist tendencies existing in human beings so that a racial world conflict erupts, I will make you very powerful and rich. Your role will consist of publishing the books which I will dictate to you, and which will enable you to create various political and spiritual movements preaching the destruction of the Arab race, the yellow race and the black race, who have taken over all the riches and the raw materials that the white race needs and deserves to have, since it was the efforts of white men which permitted them to develop techniques to search for them and to utilize them in the first place. As soon as this planetary conflict breaks out, you and all those people who have helped you to bring it about, will be saved. We will take you to safety on board one of our crafts, and eventually you will be allowed to return to Earth when everything has been destroyed, so that you can start a new humanity. You will govern this new civilization as you may desire, and with our help of course.</p>
<p>In the meantime, as soon as you return to Earth, there will be a sum of 1 billion, 5 billion, 10 billion, or more if you wish, deposited in the name of a foundation in a Swiss bank account, to help you get started. Tell us what that sum should be, and if it is not sufficient, other deposits will be made immediately.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you accept to help us, you and all of those people who will have helped you, will have the right to eternal life.</p>
<p>The only thing we ask is that you do so, so that Humanity destroys the horrible civilization that is theirs today. For this, you will also have to tell them that you have met with an extra-terrestrial, and he has warned you of an invasion of the Earth by them. We will give you the necessary proofs of our existence, and no one will doubt your words anymore. In this way, Humanity will increase its armaments to prepare itself against possible attack from the sky. This will prevent Yahweh from another approach attempting to stop men from killing each other, from building up an even greater stock of nuclear weapons and aggression on Earth.</p>
<p>Consider on the one hand, some people are asking you to work for an already lost cause, since sooner or later, men will blow themselves off the face of the Earth. These same people will not even give you proofs of their existence to help you to convince your brothers, nor any financial aid. They will leave you to face the sarcasm, the police and judicial pressures that might lead you to prison, without counting the possibility that some fanatic might kill you because you claim that there is no &quot;God&quot;. On the other hand, my proposition makes you a rich and very powerful man immediately, a man who will only have accelerated a course in which humans are already destined.</p>
<p>So, what is your decision? Do you want to think about it for a few days before giving me your answer?'</p>
<p>And I answered: 'I am not at all convinced that Humanity will self-destroy, even though there is a nine out of ten chance that it will.</p>
<p>Even if there was only one chance in a thousand that Humanity suppressed its aggression and escaped destruction, I think that it would be worthwhile taking this one chance. I would like to think that men will understand before it is too late. And even if the final cataclysm occurred, Yahweh told me that all the people who will have fought for peace and non-violence will be saved, in order to repopulate the Earth and try to build a loving world. Your proposition does not offer anything more, except perhaps that in your plan, only those people who will have contributed to the explosion of violence will be saved. The new civilization which they would then structure could not avoid being violent, because of the dominant characteristics of its founders, directly, socially and hereditarily.</p>
<p>The mere fact of telling Humanity of the invasion of Earth by extra-terrestrials would be sufficient to trigger more fear and then increase aggression on our planet. So even if there is only one chance in a thousand that the Earth could be saved at the present time, this chance would be cut in half upon hearing the news of a possible intervention on your part. One of the most important factors which can contribute to lessening violence between men is the awakening of the mind to the universe and to the infinite. If all men looked to the sky with hope and fraternity, then they would feel much closer to each other and would think less about killing each other.</p>
<p>I am not interested in becoming rich and powerful. I have almost nothing, but the little I have is all that I need to live very happily. My mission which I am accomplishing fills my life with happiness. All I need is food for my children and a roof over their heads. All of this has been given to me by faithful disciples who wish to help me bring the truth to all the people of Earth. I cannot live in two houses at the same time, nor can I drive two cars simultaneously, and even if I owned my house, that does not mean that I could sleep any better, nor would the fire be warmer. As for the mission entrusted to me by Yahweh, I would much rather that it be carried out through the collective efforts of those who wish to welcome the Elohim, as this would certainly be the most beautiful proof of love that we can give to our creators.'</p>
<p>'So you are refusing my proposition?' asked the Eloha.</p>
<p>'Yes, and for all the reasons which I have just mentioned, since I am fundamentally opposed to violence.'</p>
<p>'Are you sure you will never regret this?' he asked. 'Would you not rather wait and think about it?'</p>
<p>'I will never change my mind, no matter what happens to me. Even if my life was in danger, I would much rather direct my efforts so that love and fraternity unite all men, so that they welcome their creators, as the Elohim deserve to be welcomed.'</p>
<p>At that moment, the door opened, and Yahweh entered with the other Eloha. He told me, 'I am very pleased with the reaction that you have had to the proposals which were made to you. I was convinced of your reactions, but Satan, our brother, who has just tested you, will not be convinced that something good can be expected of men until they are united, and money and all weapons are destroyed. My second companion who is so happy with your behavior is Lucifer, who was the first to put faith in mankind even before I had understood the need to let Humanity progress, and let Man go alone through the final test of resolving violence without an intervention on our part.'</p>
<p>Satan then told me that he thought there were not more than a dozen men like me on Earth. Love and fraternity shone from his face, and he was of the opinion that it was not because some rare exceptions existed, that Humanity deserved the right to exist.</p>
<p>Then we returned to the more spacious of the two ships, the one that would bring me to the planet of the Eternals, where my  initiation was to be completed. All of this is related in the book which contains the second message, <em>Extra-Terrestrials Took Me To Their</em> <em>Planet</em>.</p>
<h2 id="my-father-who-art-in-heaven"><a class="header" href="#my-father-who-art-in-heaven">My Father Who Art in Heaven</a></h2>
<p>On my first encounter with this extra-terrestrial, whom I did not then know to be Yahweh, the president of the Council of the  Eternals, I was wondering why they had chosen me to become their messenger on Earth. He told me that they had decided to &quot;choose&quot;  someone after the first atomic explosion at Hiroshima, which took place on August 6th 1945. Then he added: 'We have been following you since your birth, and even before.' (Refer to pg. 8 of <em>The Book</em> <em>Which Tells The Truth</em>).</p>
<p>In the beginning, I found this answer to be very intriguing, and during the two years between the first and second message, I often pondered on this subject.</p>
<p>I had to wait until I met Yahweh again to clarify this matter in full.</p>
<p>He revealed the truth of my origins at the end of his remarks addressed to the people of Israel, as reported in the second message when we were then on the planet of the Eternals.</p>
<p>Once again I was told to put on one of these belts with a large buckle, which enables one to travel in the air by following certain wave currents. I found myself flying about 20 meters above luxuriant vegetation after a smooth exit from the laboratory, where my mind had been modified in the strange shell-shaped chair.</p>
<p>In ten seconds or so, we had reached a paradisiacal clearing where a few prophets, with whom I had a meal earlier, were sitting. A few hundred meters below, I could see immense and magnificent sandy beaches, bordering on a sea of deep blue waters of such depth and beauty that none of the coves of the Mediterranean sea could match it, or even come close. The blue of the water was like that of a Californian swimming pool, but it spread out to the horizon, with great pink and green areas within the blue sea. When I looked more attentively, I could see traces of every color, each more beautiful than the next, as if the bottom of the sea had been painted for some 10  kilometers. I asked where these extraordinary colors had come from, and was told that the seaweed gave the water its coloration. The seaweed had been created and implanted artistically to produce the special effect that I had noticed.</p>
<p>The belt allowed me to descend gently in the small clearing near the group of ten or so prophets. The one who had been introduced to me as Jesus, came to meet us.</p>
<p>Following Yahweh, we all went and sat on seats carved out of the rock. All the seats were covered with this marvellous black fur which seemed to be alive. We were located on a cliff overlooking the sea.</p>
<p>Yahweh asked me if during the last two years since our first meeting, there had been some question which has preoccupied me more particularly. Without hesitation, I told him that I had often wondered what he had meant when he had explained, 'we have been following you since your birth and even before.'</p>
<p>I had twisted the question many times in my mind wondering if it had meant that my parents had been chosen before my conception, and if they had been guided telepathically to each other to bear me, or if they already knew each other when they were chosen, or if I had been conceived when they were chosen, or rather when the embryo which they had created was chosen.</p>
<p>Yahweh answered this question that was very important to me. His answer was even more extraordinary than I had anticipated.</p>
<p>At that moment, he stopped addressing me in French by the polite form of <em>vous</em> and started addressing me by the personal form of <em>tu</em>. He then said:</p>
<p>'The person whom you looked upon as your father was not your real father. After the explosion at Hiroshima, we decided that the time had come for us to send a new messenger on Earth. He would be the last prophet, but the first one to address Mankind asking them to understand and not to believe. We then selected a woman, as we had done in the time of Jesus. This woman was taken aboard one of our ships and inseminated as we had done with the mother of Jesus.</p>
<p>Then she was freed after we had totally erased from her memory all traces of what had happened.</p>
<p>But before all of this had happened, we had arranged so that she would meet a man, who could support the child financially and would raise him decently. This man had to be from a different religion than that of the woman so that the child could be raised without strong religious conditioning. This is why the man whom you took for your father and believed that he truly was, was a Jew.</p>
<p>Your real father is also the father of Jesus, and that makes you brothers. You are presently looking at your father. Your foster-father was like Joseph, he was to take care of you and your mother until such time as you could provide for yourself. From this moment on, you can talk to me using <em>tu</em>, because you are my son and I am your father.'</p>
<p>Of the entire journey, this was the most touching moment. And I could see in Yahweh's eyes an equally great emotion and feeling of love. Jesus too seemed to be moved by the same feelings. Then I kissed my father and my brother for the very first time.</p>
<p>Then Yahweh asked me not to reveal this parental tie until three years had passed. This is the reason why I have never talked about it until now.</p>
<p>In any case, it is of no importance, we must not make the same mistake as those men who recognized Jesus as a messenger who came from the heavens. It is not the messenger who is important, but the message itself.</p>
<p>'Jesus came on Earth to show the way but men kept looking at his finger.', said a great thinker, and it is unfortunately true.</p>
<p>I, Rael, am also showing you the path to follow, in revealing the messages given to me by my father &quot;who is in heaven&quot;. It is more important to recognize the Elohim as our fathers and to prepare their embassy on Earth as they requested, than to pay attention to the messenger. Only the messages are important and through them the recognition of those who sent them, but not the messenger.</p>
<p>Do not look at my finger, but rather in the direction in which it's
pointed.</p>
<h2 id="message-from-yahweh-to-the-men-of-the-earth-the-apocalypse-of-the-final-nuclear-cataclysm"><a class="header" href="#message-from-yahweh-to-the-men-of-the-earth-the-apocalypse-of-the-final-nuclear-cataclysm">Message from Yahweh to the Men of the Earth: The Apocalypse of the Final Nuclear Cataclysm</a></h2>
<p>I, Yahweh, through the words of my prophet Rael, address all the people of Earth:</p>
<p>There is, unfortunately, but one chance in one hundred that your Humanity will not self-destroy, and every Raelian must act as if Mankind would be wise enough to understand and grab this tiny chance of escaping the final cataclysm, so as to enter the Golden Age.</p>
<p>Better still, each Raelian, by his work of awakening minds,  contributes to strengthening this unique and minute chance of survival to prevent it from becoming even weaker.</p>
<p>It is impossible to predict the future, for it is impossible to travel in time, but it is always possible to predict the future of a biological entity, and the whole of Humanity can be considered as a biological entity. If a primitive woman was inseminated by a scientist, the latter could predict this woman's future. He could predict that in nine months she would give birth to a child, and could even go so far as determining the sex of the child.</p>
<p>In the same way, we who are used to creating life on an infinity of planets, know what happens to a Humanity which has reached your level of technology, without having reached an equivalent level of wisdom.</p>
<p>This is why, although we cannot predict the future of individuals, we can predict, however, what should normally happen to a living organism during the gestation period or to a Humanity in the course of its development.</p>
<p>When the first cell is created in the mother's womb by the meeting of the spermatozoon and the ovule, this first cell contains all the necessary information to create a complete being, able to accomplish a multitude of functions. And the more numerous the cells, the more numerous are the functions developed. The number of functions is proportional to the number of cells obtained by successive divisions, until the child is ready to be born, because only then does he become a complete organism, with all the organs which he will require to accomplish all the functions which will fill his every need.</p>
<p>It is exactly the same thing for humanity, considering each human to be
like a cell of the great being in gestation, that is, Humanity.</p>
<p>The number of functions, of discoveries, and the technological level of Mankind is proportional to the number of humans. In this way, we can easily predict that the age of the Apocalypse will be achieved when Men are able to make the blind recover their sight with electronic prostheses, when Man's voice will be carried beyond the oceans through satellite telecommunication, and when Man will be equal to those he had mistaken for &quot;God&quot;, by creating synthetic beings in a laboratory, etc. </p>
<p>All these predictions rely on an in-depth knowledge of the biology of the species. We know that a foetus will develop his eyes at a certain month of his growth, and his sexual organs at another month, and that the same rule applies to all living species which are developing.</p>
<p>We know that it will make discoveries permitting the  ccomplishment of such and such a scientific prowess after so many undreds or thousands of years. It's exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>We have dictated our messages to the prophets of old, so as to be ecognized by men when the time would come for us to show</p>
<p>ourselves openly, without this creating new deistic religions, i.e. when ll men would be capable of understanding.</p>
<p>Among these texts is the <em>Apocalypse,</em> which we dictated to John. We howed him, through a visualizer similar to your television sets, the vents which would happen to men when they would reach the Age of the pocalypse.</p>
<p>The text of the Apocalypse of John was unfortunately overloaded and istorted by primitive transcribers who could not be anything other than od-believing people.</p>
<p>John starts his story by telling of his encounter with us:</p>
<p>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great
voice, as of a trumpet.17 <em>Revelation 1: 10.</em></p>
<p>Here he explains that he is trying to communicate with us  elepathically, this is what he calls being &quot;in the spirit&quot; on the unday, referred to as the &quot;Lord's day&quot;, and that he heard a metallic oice &quot;as of a trumpet&quot;; this is something you all know: The sounds roduced by an electrical loudspeaker.</p>
<p>Then John turned around to see what was behind him:</p>
<p>Then I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a  garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band.</p>
<p>His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire; His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters;  He had in His right hand seven stars, out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and His countenance was like the sun shining in its strength.12 <em>Revelation 1: 12-16.</em></p>
<p>John saw seven flying machines made of a golden metal, &quot;seven golden lampstands&quot;, in the middle of which stood a little being, &quot;one like the Son of Man&quot;, dressed in a flying suit which was molded to his body, even his feet, and he is wearing a large belt. His skin and his hair are white; his helmet is equipped with two small projectors which John mistook for his eyes. His feet are standing on thick, insulated soles of yellow metal, and he speaks with a powerful voice, &quot;and his voice as the sound of many waters&quot;.</p>
<p>In his hand, the little person holds an apparatus made of seven luminous signals, which are bridged to the seven vessels placed near him. The two-edged sword, on the other hand, is only a detail added later on by the transcribers to reinforce the menace of apparition, to increase the power of &quot;God&quot; and the fear of &quot;God&quot; of the first Christians. The being who appeared in front of John was indeed one of us.</p>
<p>John, panic-stricken, fell with his face to the ground:</p>
<p>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, 'Fear not; I am the first and the last, and the Living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades. Write  therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass hereafter.' <em>Revelation 1: 17-20</em></p>
<p>We asked John to get up, and we told him that he must write  everything that he had seen, and everything that would be dictated to him, so that men could find those writings when the time would come. We told him that we were &quot;the first and the last&quot;, that is to say, the first on Earth and the last if men self-destroy when they discover energies to permit them to do so. We explained to him that the one who was speaking had known death, but had been re-created, thanks to the process explained in the first message, which permits us to live eternally through many bodies.</p>
<p>And behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, a voice as of a trumpet speaking with me, one saying, Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which must come to pass hereafter.</p>
<p>Straightway I was in the Spirit: and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne.17 <em>Revelation 4: 1-2.</em></p>
<p>John sees &quot;a door opened in heaven&quot;; the door of one of our  machines is opened, and he is taken inside on a carrying ray. This is totally incomprehensible for him, and this is why he says, &quot;in the spirit&quot;.</p>
<p>There he sees someone sitting in a chair and around him a total of other people also sitting on &quot;thrones&quot;.</p>
<p>I, Yahweh, was this person sitting on the throne, and around me were sitting 24 other Eternals representing the Council of the Eternals, the governing body of our planet.</p>
<p>Then I turned on the apparatus designed to visualize thoughts, and he saw what would normally happen to Humanity, and also what would happen when the time would come:</p>
<p>And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. <em>Revelation 6: 2.</em></p>
<p>This is in relation to the first of the seven seals, or if you prefer, the seven chapters of the history of Humanity. This is, in fact, the triumph of Christianity on Earth, and it allows The Old Testament to be revealed to everyone. Then the second seal is opened:</p>
<p>And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. <em>Revelation 6: 4.</em></p>
<p>This red horse represents the religious wars and wars in general, which will be one of the principal causes in the tardiness of humans to increase their number. Then comes the third seal:</p>
<p>And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</p>
<p>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, 'A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine'. <em>Revelation 6: 5-6.</em></p>
<p>The black horse is the famine, which will claim a considerable number of lives before Mankind solves the problem on Earth completely. And then comes the fourth seal:</p>
<p>And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. <em>Revelation 6: 8.</em></p>
<p>This pale horse represents the great epidemics and plagues, and many others which have decimated Humanity. Then the fifth seal is broken:</p>
<p>When He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held.</p>
<p>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, 'How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?'</p>
<p>Then a white robe was given to each of them; and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both the number of their fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was completed.12 <em>Revelation 6: 9-11.</em></p>
<p>This scene represents what happened when the great prophets, living eternally in our company on our planet, asked us to allow men who had lived a positive life to be re-created before the final judgment. We gave permission so that a few thousand people from Earth, who we re-created, could live among us immediately, whereas first we had decided to keep their genetic code in order to re-create them only when Humanity had completed its evolution. Then the sixth seal was opened:</p>
<p>I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood. And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind.</p>
<p>Then the sky receded as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place.</p>
<p>And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man,  hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.12 <em>Revelation 6: 12-15.</em></p>
<p>The sixth seal represents the final danger for Humanity, the greatest danger, the one which could destroy it completely: the atomic war. The &quot;great earthquake&quot; is the explosion itself, the &quot;black sun&quot; is the darkening of the sky by the mushroom cloud, and the fallout dust that you all know so well will darken the moon. &quot;The sky receded as a scroll&quot; is when the clouds are chased abruptly by the sudden surge of hot air coming from the explosion. The men who hide in the rocks of the mountains are the people who rush into anti-nuclear shelters. It is from this final cataclysm, if it happens, that people who will have followed our prophet, will be saved - those people who will have had their cellular plan transmitted after having read or heard of the messages.</p>
<p>Those people will have been selected by our huge computer, which follows all people from conception to death.</p>
<p>Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea, saying, 'Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.'12 <em>Revelation 7: 2-3.</em></p>
<p>The people who will be sealed in the forehead will be those who will have their cellular plan transmitted by manual contact between our prophet and their forehead bone, which contains the purest and the most authentic genetic code. The total of those who will be  &quot;sealed in the forehead&quot; will be around 144,000, which will include those people already re-created on our planet, those people who will have led a life dedicated to the blossoming of Humanity without ever hearing of the messages, and also those people who will recognize Rael as our messenger after having read the messages.</p>
<p>For as long as the total of these human beings does not reach 144,000, we will help to delay the final cataclysm, so as to have a sufficient number to start a new generation on Earth, when it has become a suitable place again for humans to live.</p>
<p>If the sixth seal represents the discovery and the first utilization of the atomic weapon, the seventh seal represents the final cataclysm, a worldwide atomic war, which ends with the destruction of all life on Earth.</p>
<p>When the first trumpet of the seventh seal sounded:</p>
<p>...and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. <em>Revelation 8: 7.</em></p>
<p>One third of the Earth is burnt by radioactivity; the trees and the green grass no longer grow.</p>
<p>And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed. <em>Revelation 8: 8-9.</em></p>
<p>The explosion produced an enormous eruption of lava which ran into the ocean, destroying one third of the marine life and one third of the ships.</p>
<p>And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. <em>Revelation 8: 10-11.</em></p>
<p>Atomic explosions follow in retort to the first attack; the missiles,  &quot;great burning stars from Heaven&quot;, fall everywhere. Most of the drinking water becomes polluted, and many people die from it.</p>
<p>And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise. <em>Revelation 8: 12.</em></p>
<p>The dust and the ashes raised by successive nuclear explosions are so thick that the sky is darkened, obscuring the Sun, the Moon and the stars, which gives the impression that the day and the night are shorter.</p>
<p>And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.</p>
<p>And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. <em>Revelation 9: 1-2.</em></p>
<p>This is the description of a missile falling and the mushroom cloud it creates.</p>
<p>Then out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth. And to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</p>
<p>They were commanded not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</p>
<p>And they were not given authority to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.</p>
<p>In those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will desire to die, and death will flee from them. <em>Revelation 9: 3-6.</em></p>
<p>The locusts are airplanes loaded with atomic bombs which will fall on the great cities, and through exposure to radioactivity, will inflict terrible suffering on those people who will have survived the explosions. They will be poisoned by radiation, in much the same way as one can be poisoned by the sting of a scorpion.</p>
<p>And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.</p>
<p>And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.</p>
<p>And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.</p>
<p>And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months. <em>Revelation 9: 7-10.</em></p>
<p>Those metallic locusts covered with metal, looked like horses going to war, in the eyes of a primitive man. They had a cockpit inside of which a man's face could be seen &quot;as the faces of men&quot;, and in flying very high, they left behind a trail of white smoke that John calls hair, and their &quot;teeth&quot; are the missiles tucked under their wings. The  &quot;breastplates of iron&quot; are the fuselage, and the noise comes from the jet engines, as is familiar to you. The power in the &quot;tails like unto scorpions&quot; is the radiation produced by the missiles which were dropped on the population of the countries that were attacked.</p>
<p>And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before Yahweh... <em>Revelation 9: 13.</em></p>
<p>John describes the four loud-speakers located in front of me while I was making him see all this.</p>
<p>And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.</p>
<p>By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.</p>
<p>For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. <em>Revelation 9: 17-19.</em></p>
<p>Again this is the description of more planes; the &quot;heads of the horses&quot; are the jet-engines from which flames and smoke come out.</p>
<p>The tail with &quot;heads, with them they do hurt&quot; are the nuclear missiles, and you can understand that the &quot;heads&quot; refers to the head of the missile, whether it's self-directed or not. We gave John the most detailed description possible, and this story reflects what he had seen with his primitive eyes. Take this same story and tell it to an Amazonian Indian, then ask him to write it down in his own words, and you will get approximately the same type of recollection, more so, if you ask 10 of his fellow tribe members to transcribe the story, while the first man is not present.</p>
<p>And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was  about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, 'Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.' <em>Revelation 10: 4.</em></p>
<p>At this point we clearly told John that there was no &quot;God&quot; and that we were men like him, and also we explained that he should keep this as a secret and not write it, so as not to create a greater confusion among the people who still needed a crutch to lean on, until the day when Humanity had reached a sufficient level of technology when everyone could understand what we had spoken of.</p>
<p>But in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God would be finished, as He declared to His servants the prophets.12 <em>Revelation 10: 7.</em></p>
<p>We clearly explained to him that when the time would come, men would understand that there is no &quot;God&quot; and by the same token would also understand that we were their creators.</p>
<p>...for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. <em>Revelation 12: 12.</em></p>
<p>This final test of Humanity, that is, the choice between self-destruction or the passage into the Golden Age, is the last  opportunity for Satan to prove that he was right in saying that humanity was bad.</p>
<p>If Humanity brilliantly overcomes this last ordeal and succeeds in obtaining total disarmament on the planet, then men will have proven themselves worthy of receiving our inheritance, since they will have shown they are truly non-violent. The &quot;beast&quot;, as described further on in the text, is simply the use of nuclear energy for murderous means: </p>
<p>Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the  number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his  number is Six hundred threescore and six. <em>Revelation 13: 18.</em></p>
<p>In fact, 666 is the number of human generations which will have existed on Earth since the creation of the first men in the original laboratories. The very first humans were created some 13,000 years ago, and a human generation is estimated at an average of 20 years, so if one multiplies 666 by 20, it equals 13,320 years.</p>
<p>The generation born at the beginning of the Age of Apocalypse in 1945 of the Christian era, was in fact the 666th since the creation of the first man in a laboratory by the Elohim. This generation coincides precisely with the first use of nuclear energy for destructive purposes at Hiroshima, on August 6th, 1945.</p>
<p>Once again, interpretation was not required in order to  understand. One had only to read what had been written. 666 was effectively the &quot;number of Man&quot;, the number of men who descended from the creation, that is to say, the number of generations.</p>
<p>And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. <em>Revelation 16: 18.</em></p>
<p>The after-shocks from the atomic explosions are tremendous, and they are increased if they start a chain reaction.</p>
<p>And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. <em>Revelation 16: 20.</em></p>
<p>This monstrous explosion due to a chain reaction will brutally divide the continents, engulfing the islands and sweeping the mountains like a wisp of straw. </p>
<p>And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about
the weight of a talent. <em>Revelation 16: 21.</em></p>
<p>In those parts of the Earth untouched by the bombs, rocks are falling from the sky, thousands of kilometers away from where the bombs had fallen.</p>
<p>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. <em>Revelation 21: 1.</em></p>
<p>John was able to see what one could see from a rocket moving away from the Earth. It seemed as if it was the Earth that was retreating, rather than the craft itself moving away. Then the spacecraft travels through a starlit sky unfamiliar to a man of the Earth, &quot;a new Heaven&quot;. Then the spaceship reaches another planet, &quot;a new Earth&quot;.</p>
<p>And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from Yahweh out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <em>Revelation 21: 2.</em></p>
<p>Looking from the spacecraft, the primitive has the feeling that the city towards which the spacecraft is going, is &quot;coming down out of Heaven&quot;, while it is evidently the spacecraft that is approaching.</p>
<p>And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, 'Behold, the tabernacle of Yahweh is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and Yahweh himself shall be with them, and be their Elohim.</p>
<p>And Yahweh shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.' <em>Revelation 21: 3-4.</em></p>
<p>This is the description of the planet of the Eternals, where all the people that we will save from the final cataclysm will live with us while waiting to be re-implanted on Earth when it will be habitable again, in order to re-create a peaceful civilization.</p>
<p>This is the outcome with which Humanity is faced, if it does not reach a level of wisdom as high as its level of technology.</p>
<p>All this was seen by a primitive, because John was a primitive compared to us, as was Moses, as was Jesus as well, as were all the prophets compared to our level, before we gave them a sufficient initiation so that they could foresee what was a certain mastery of matter. Your most advanced scientists are also primitive compared to what we can achieve today, the same as the Indians of the Amazon are, compared to the scientists at Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p>This is, unfortunately, what awaits Humanity, with a 99 per cent probability of occurring.</p>
<p>So that all of you who recognize us as your creators and who recognize Rael as our last messenger on Earth, all of you must wrestle to ensure that Humanity reaches out to this one little chance of survival, by revealing our messages to the whole of Mankind. If this is what you are doing, you can live in peace, and all the while try to expand and fulfill yourselves even more, for if you are among the just, who are doing everything within their power so that the truth and non-violence may finally triumph, you can rest assured that we will save you from the final cataclysm, if it should ever happen. Strive for love, strive for fraternity, strive for intelligence, but do not despair if you see that the great majority of men remain violent, aggressive and stupid. Whichever way you look at it, your efforts will be rewarded.</p>
<p>Either Humanity will develop an interplanetary consciousness, and the whole of Mankind will enter the Golden Age, or everything will explode, and you will be those who we will save to rebuild everything.</p>
<p>I, Yahweh, the alpha and the omega, he who was the first one on Earth and also he who will be the last, I am sending this message to all humans of the Earth through the words of my prophet, Rael, to all those humans whom we have created, and whom we have tried to lead towards the Golden Age, and who we love as if they were our own
children.</p>
<p>Peace on Earth to all men of good-will and to all those who have the will to be happy.</p>
<p>Our inheritance is ready, let us hope that the child will not die at birth.</p>
<p>It's your move!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An angel from Heaven contacted me. He said that I was the  Messiah of the Apocalypse and told me to go and evangelize the earth, and to create the church of which I would be the pope and pontiff, I, the prophet of this Catholic religion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those people who know me, would probably say in reading these words: 'That's it, now he has become irrational, the immensity of his task has caused a serious psychological disorder, and he is betraying the cause.'</p>
<p>This introduction could be interpreted at first as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A being with wings, coming from the sky, contacted me. He told me that I was a divine being, sent to announce the end of the world, and that I should set out to preach the Gospel all over the earth, and to build a church with stones and cement, of which I would be the pope with a tiara and the pontiff sitting on a throne and I, the prophet of this Catholic religion affiliated to Rome, I was going to announce what is going to happen in the centuries to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now let us try to find the true hidden meaning of the words contained in this sentence.</p>
<p>As we have done for the words <em>Elohim</em> and <em>Apocalypse</em>, we must first of all search the etymology, or true meaning of each important word.</p>
<p>While we are at it, let us start with the etymology of the word <em>Etymology</em>, that is to say, its original meaning from the Greek <em>eutemos</em> which means &quot;true&quot;, and <em>logos</em> which means &quot;science&quot;. The &quot;science of that word which is true&quot; or the &quot;science of the truth&quot;. What could be more natural for people who are gathered around <em>The Book Which</em> <em>Tells The Truth</em> than to be etymologists, &quot;seekers of the truth&quot;?</p>
<p><em>Elohim</em> was wrongly translated by the word <em>God</em>, since it really meant &quot;those who came from the sky&quot; in Hebrew, and <em>Apocalypse</em> was translated by &quot;the end of the world&quot; and all the while it meant <em>Revelation</em>, as we are all now aware. So let us take the words one by one in this apparently mystical introduction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An angel from the sky contacted me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us look it up in the dictionary: <em>angel</em> from the Greek <em>angelos</em> means &quot;messenger&quot;. That alone changes the whole meaning. We can now read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A messenger from the sky contacted me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The supernatural becomes understandable. Let's continue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He told me that I was the Messiah of the Apocalypse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Messiah</em> from the Aramean <em>meschika</em> means &quot;anointed by the Lord&quot;  or &quot;sacred, chosen by the Lord&quot;. Let's first look at the word <em>Lord</em> to better understand the word <em>messiah.</em> One discovers that the word <em>Lord</em> - <em>seigneur</em> in French - comes from the Latin <em>senior</em>, meaning &quot;the oldest&quot;. According to the vocabulary of the middle-ages, the &quot;Lord&quot; was a person who ruled over a province. The &quot;God&quot; in whom <em>The</em> <em>Bible</em> would make us believe is eternal, is obviously &quot;the oldest&quot;, thus the &quot;Lord&quot; ruling the Earth. Through time, the word was  transformed, and the Catholic religion adopted &quot;my Lord&quot; -- 
&quot;Monseigneur&quot; in French, equivalent to the English word <em>sire</em>.</p>
<p>When the revolution came -- in France -- removing all the Lords, unfortunately it spared those within the religion, which is why within it, we still address bishops etc., as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;Monseigneur&quot;.</p>
<p>So then, <em>messiah</em> means &quot;chosen by God&quot;, and as we know <em>God</em> is a bad translation of the word <em>Elohim</em> which means &quot;those who came from the sky&quot;, so we can therefore say that, in fact, <em>messiah</em> means &quot;the one chosen by those who came from the sky&quot;. As we have already seen, <em>apocalypse</em>, from the Greek, means &quot;revelation&quot;, and so we can write clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He told me that I had been chosen by those who came from the sky for the Revelation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's all clear. But let's continue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...to go and evangelize the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Evangelize</em>, is from the Greek word <em>euagelion</em> which means &quot;good
news&quot;. Then we can read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...to go and spread the good news on Earth,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...to create a church.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Church</em> -- <em>eglise</em> in French -- <em>ekklesia</em> in Greek, which means &quot;assembly&quot;. Then it becomes: to create an assembly.</p>
<p>Then it is written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...of which I would be the pope and pontiff</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Pope</em> from the Greek <em>pappas</em> means &quot;father&quot;, and <em>pontiff</em> from the Latin <em>pontiflex</em> means &quot;to link&quot;, like a bridge links two shores, or two places on the Earth, or one planet to another planet.</p>
<p>We can thus clearly read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...of which I will be the father and the liaison person between the planet of our creators and the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And lastly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I, the prophet of this Catholic religion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Prophet</em> from the Greek <em>prophetes</em> means &quot;the one who reveals&quot;.</p>
<p><em>Religion</em> from the Latin <em>religio</em> means &quot;that which links&quot; or &quot;the tie&quot;, which unites the creators to their creation. <em>Catholic</em> from the Greek <em>katholikos</em> which means &quot;universal&quot;.</p>
<p>Therefore, the end of the sentence means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I, the one whose mission is to reveal the universal tie which unites Man and his creators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's put all the pieces together, and we read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A messenger from the sky contacted me. He told me that I had been chosen by those who came from the sky, for the revelation, to go and spread the good news on Earth, to create an assembly, of which I would be the father and the liaison-person between the planet of our creators and Earth, I, the one whose mission is to reveal the universal tie which unites men and their creators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take the mysticism out of the words, then the sentence becomes rationally understandable for everyone. And yet the  sentence at the beginning of this chapter had exactly the same meaning. In the mind of a mystical, narrow-minded primitive as shown, our example demonstrates clearly how easy it is to change the true sense of a sentence if the precise meaning of the words is not respected.</p>
<p>Thus it becomes clear that the Raelian Movement is a religion; it ties the creators of Humanity with their creation, even if it is in fact an atheist religion, in the sense that it does not believe in the existence of a God - <em>atheist</em> from the Greek <em>atheos</em> which means &quot;denying the existence of any form of divinity&quot;.</p>
<p>Many people say that the practice of a cult defines the character of a religion. What is a cult? Derived from the Latin <em>cultus</em> meaning  &quot;tribute rendered to a God&quot;, but we would then say &quot;tribute rendered to the creators&quot;, since <em>Elohim</em> is a plural. The telepathic contact on Sunday mornings at 11 o'clock, the obligation of thinking at least once a day about the Elohim (Book 2, pg. 175), the obligation of inviting the regional Guide at least once a year to one's table so that he can talk about the messages, the monthly meeting with the regional Guide, the annual meeting on the 6th of August to celebrate the entry into the Age of Apocalypse - all of those ceremonies could be qualified as a cult, for each one of them is designed to pay tribute to our creators, at regular intervals, alone or in groups.</p>
<p>Even if the Raelians do not believe in a &quot;God&quot;, they still recognize Jesus as a messenger sent by our creators, just as they do Moses, Buddha, Mohammed, Joseph Smith, and all the other great prophets who have lived on this Earth, and await their return in the company of the Elohim as the scriptures have predicted. The Raelian believes in the deeper meaning of the scriptures, more particularly the biblical <em>Genesis</em>, but also in the <em>Koran</em> and many other religious books, all their writings being stripped of their mystical meaning by the messages of the Elohim.</p>
<p>Therefore the Raelian ignores the human laws which have been grafted to the religious writings, these laws having been made by Men, so as to enforce respect for governments and laws which were purely human.</p>
<p>The tribute which we render to the Elohim could be called a &quot;cult&quot;, why not? The cult in itself is not wrong, so long as it is not performed by people who think of the Elohim as being divinities, but rather by people who love them sincerely for the extraordinary act of love which they have accomplished in giving us life, and in leaving us free to progress by ourselves until such a time as we would be equal to them.</p>
<p>There is no need to kneel down or to lie down with your face in the dirt, under the stars, but rather look up at the sky, standing tall, proud of being conscious of the privilege of living in this day and age when we are able to understand and show love for our creators, to love them for the fantastic potential they gave us to create life by mastering and transforming minute particles of matter at our level, to raise towards the galaxies, a forehead full of love and hope, the hope to one day meet those to whom we owe our existence and the fact to be able to understand why we are here and what our mission is in the infinite of space and time.</p>
<p>Until recently, Humanity was worshipping the creators who had created each man with the ability to understand the creators, so now Man must understand the creators, so as to be able to love them even more.</p>
<p>If Mankind uses science negatively, and a fatal nuclear cataclysm occurs, all those people who will have worked to prevent this catastrophe by trying to make Mankind aware of its errors in the name of the Elohim, those people shall be saved by our creators.</p>
<p>Those people who have faith in our fathers will be rewarded by the Elohim who have already provided access to eternal life on their planet, where all the great prophets sent to Earth to awaken Humanity are presently living. The word <em>faith</em> comes from the Latin <em>fides</em> and means &quot;commitment, link&quot;. So, it is therefore possible to &quot;believe without understanding&quot;, while, at the same time, giving your trust to the Elohim, having faith in them, because those who have the intelligence to have faith in them will be rewarded regardless. While trying to prevent Humanity from committing the irrevocable error, a Raelian has faith in the Elohim, because he knows that they will not forget him in the event of a fatal cataclysm.</p>
<h2 id="deresponsibilisation"><a class="header" href="#deresponsibilisation">Deresponsibilisation</a></h2>
<p>If there had been a newspaper in Jerusalem 2,000 years ago, it would have reported on the unemployment, the energy crisis due to a shortage of slaves, and also of the ever increasing cost of living due to the exorbitant Roman taxes. These headlines would have fed the front-page of all the newspapers, if they existed, and would have fed all the conversations. Then there would have been a few lines written by the official &quot;scientists&quot; of the day, or an editor seeking recognition, on this false prophet claiming to be &quot;the king of the Jews&quot;, and it would be suggested to the authorities that this man be arrested immediately because he is dragging a hoard of credulous people, his  &quot;followers&quot;, around with him. One should not abuse the public's credulity in this way...</p>
<p>So this &quot;illuminated person&quot; is then arrested, tried and sentenced to death. This man who had dedicated his life to spreading the messages of our creators will be found crucified between two bandits.</p>
<p>What crime had he committed? Unlawful practice of the truth  reserved only for the representatives of the officially registered religions: those which had been in existence for at least two or three hundred years? You could call it a sort of &quot;controlled appellation&quot;. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.12 <em>Matthew 27: 20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;high priests&quot; of the official religions and the news media convince the masses that a religion has to be a few thousand years old in order to be &quot;acceptable&quot;, and so all the others are nothing more than dangerous sects.</p>
<p>All of those people stand between Man and the truth, by allowing Man to believe in the religion of the &quot;high priests&quot; of the State -- those scientists who claim that Man comes from the monkey, but who, on the other hand, baptize their children and place a cross on the grave of their parents. They also obstruct the truth by allowing Man to believe in the religion of traditions, which permit the great fundamentals of our rotting society to survive a few years longer, which promote and protect the family as a tax-payer, as a stagnant closed system, and a strangler of personalities, which uphold the nation which feeds the political men, who are capable of doing anything to continue to get their pay. The military also do exactly the same thing, as do, finally, all the low paid government employees who have been taught not to feel responsible for their own actions and who think they are protecting society when they condemn, torture or even kill someone.</p>
<p>These are the religions that governments endorse, but by the same token, they try to eliminate the ones that could make the young generation vibrate with joy when it discovers the truth, which could get them to think of destroying the outdated primitive structures and replacing them by newer ones, much more adaptable to the futuristic technological world in which we live.</p>
<p>The top priority of all those people who wish to manipulate the population is to take away human responsibility, it is called maximum &quot;deresponsibilisation&quot;. They are well aware as to why it should be so. They know that a soldier will not kill someone else unless he is totally convinced that he is doing it for a cause, that same way that this soldier will not torture a prisoner unless he has been convinced that this will help a great cause. They also know that a citizen will oppose paying higher taxes unless he is told that it is to help the farmers or victims of drought.</p>
<p>People will do anything for a great cause. The art of governing is to convince people of the greatness of their country.</p>
<p>American scientists have recently conducted a conclusive  experiment in the field of responsibility. They hired actors who would pretend to be subjects in an experiment on the potential of human violence. Then through classified ads, they recruited people willing to participate in an experiment to explore the possibilities of the human brain. The people were placed one at a time at a desk equipped with different levers which were supposed to send electrical charges to a cubicle in which actors pretend to receive the charge. There were thirty levers in all, which could supposedly each send out a charge of 15 volts and so altogether could send charges of 15 to 450 volts. They were placed from left to right, and indicated whether the electric charge would be light, moderately strong or very strong. On the other hand, the actor could see the lights light up on the panel in front of him showing the intensity of the shock he was supposed to have received from the electric chair to which he was tied, and he could therefore act accordingly. If the shock was light, he would simulate a light reaction, if it was moderate, he would jump a little more and give out a little cry, then he would protest by saying that he did not wish to continue the experiment; if the intensity was increased, he would scream and beg to be released, and finally when the maximum voltage of 450 volts was reached, he would pretend to collapse. The shocks were sent to the actors by those people who had been recruited in classified ads. However, the recruits did not realize that they were actors, and thought that they were sending real shocks to real people.</p>
<p>The actor was asked a simple question by a scientist, and when he answered incorrectly, the classified ads recruits were to let them know by giving them an electrical shock. This same scientist was urging the sender to increase the voltage consistently, without listening to the supplications of the receiver, saying to the sender that this experiment would help science to progress immensely, and therefore all of humanity.</p>
<p>This experiment, in which the observer was really the one being observed, was repeated many times, so that statistics could be established to know how many people would go as far as killing other people in the name of scientific progress. It was also conducted in many countries, so that the results could be compared and analyzed.</p>
<p>Contrary to the expectations of the scientists who had put together this experiment, and the psychologists whom they had consulted, it was not just a minority of people who were unbalanced enough to go as far as pushing the 450 volt lever. In the US, 60 per cent of the people obeyed the scientist, who told them not to listen to the cries of those whom they were electrocuting, and continued to administer shocks, even when those being shocked could no longer say anything, which itself counted as an incorrect answer; and this three times in a row, after which a new electrocutor was selected. This experiment was also conducted in many European countries, where over 70 per cent of the people went as far as the maximum voltage. The record high was reached in Germany where 85 per cent of the people would have been responsible for homicide by electrocution...</p>
<p>The conclusion of Professor Stanley Milgram of the Department of Psychology at Yale University is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the individuals are placed in a position of hierarchical control, the mechanisms which ordinarily assure the regulation of the individual's actions cease functioning, and his actions become controlled by the people occupying the senior position...The disappearance of the sense of responsibility is the greatest consequence of submission to authority...</p>
<p>Most of the subjects place their behavior in a large context of undertakings, useful to society: the research of scientific truth. A laboratory of psychology could clearly claim to this legitimacy, and so inspire confidence in those who were invited to work.</p>
<p>An act such as the electrocution of a victim, which seems bad when considered on its own, takes on a completely different meaning when placed in this environment.</p>
<p>Morality does not disappear, but it is focused in a radically different way: the subordinate person experiences shame and  pride depending on his good or bad execution of the act  commanded by the authority. Language offers a great number of terms to designate this type of moral: loyalty, sense of duty, discipline...</p>
<p>Such is without doubt the fundamental lesson of our study: the ordinary people, by simply doing their job, and without any  particular hostility on their part, could become agents in a terribly destructive process.</p>
<p>Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become absolutely evident, and one asks them to execute actions  incompatible with the fundamental norms of morality, relatively few people have the interior resources needed to resist authority.</p>
<p>It is a mortal fault which seems to be natural in most people, and which, in the long run, leaves our species with only a mediocre chance of survival.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's quite clear. Now we can understand why Jesus was crucified, why millions of people died at the hands of the Inquisition, during religious or civil wars, and in the Nazi massacres. It becomes easier to understand how an honest greengrocer or banker could have been a crucifier, or burn witches or become an SS soldier, sending women and children to the death chambers. They all thought they were doing something for the good of Humanity. The first ones were getting rid of an &quot;illuminated&quot; man who wanted to overthrow their traditions, and others felt that people who lived differently were surely responsible for the bad crops or the plague or even the economic crisis. The fact that ideas so stupid could germinate in the brains of retarded people is forgivable. What is not, is thae governments could use the masses by utilizing such monstrous ideas te motivate them and give them reasons to act.</p>
<p>The French leaders in Algeria acted along this same principle. Thee forced their officers into torturing North-Africans under the pretense of obtaining information useful to their country. Those officers who die the torturing even considered that they were &quot;sacrificing themselves&quot;e by acting this way, &quot;bravely&quot;, in the best interests of their country.</p>
<p>Men of the Earth, be very vigilant and do not accomplish the slightese action without asking yourself whether it is in contradiction to youe deep sense of respect for the human being. Refuse any hierarchy implyine a suppression of your responsibility for the actions you carry out.</p>
<p>Every Nazi war criminal, while on trial, defended himself in good faithe by claiming that he was only following orders. The man who launched the bomb on Hiroshima was only following orders. In every powerful countrye there are people who are ready to launch nuclear missiles in good faite and with a clear conscience, knowing that they are only &quot;doing theie duty in executing the orders received&quot;. They are responsible for theie actions! In every part of Nazi Germany, men, women and children were tortured because people were following orders, and according to them the only man responsible for all of this would be Hitler. It would be muce too easy if it were so! For example, there are hundreds of nucleae missiles ready to be launched from France and destined for othee countries where thousands of women and children are living, and if the massacre happened, would the only man held to be responsible for it be the President of the Republic? Of course not! Each man holding the powee to kill others is personally responsible for the utilization of thie power. The man who lights the crematorium furnace where children lie moaning, is more responsible than the one who has given the order in the first place, just as the man who delivers a bomb on a city is more responsible than the one who made the decision.</p>
<p>Each person is totally responsible for his actions and can never hide behind the excuse that he was only following the orders which had been given to him by his superiors.</p>
<p>If tomorrow I were to ask anyone of you to kill someone so that our movement may progress faster, you must not do it. Better still, if an Eloha were to ask you to kill another man, you should refuse to do it, for it would probably be Satan who would be trying to prove to the Eternals that all men are fundamentally bad.</p>
<p>All your actions should be based on a deep feeling of respect for the life of others, their ideas, and their tastes. We fight ideologies without ever using violent physical actions towards those who do not agree with us.</p>
<p>Awaken the people around you, show them how to become  respectful of other people and how to refuse &quot;deresponsibilisation&quot;, whose most dangerous propagator is the armed forces. Remember, 85 per cent in Germany and 60 per cent in the USA. You must use all your energy so that tomorrow there is only 10 per cent of weak-headed people who would agree to perform violent actions ordered by a political and military hierarchy.</p>
<p>Those who killed Jesus did it in all serenity. They were not responsible; they were only following orders. Pontius Pilate himself refused to endorse the responsibility for this crime, and he &quot;washed his hands&quot; of the whole mess. He allowed the fanatics conditioned by the rabbis, just like the SS, to crucify Jesus. If we were to ask all those people if they feel responsible, none of them probably would. They would all &quot;wash their hands&quot; like the Romans did. The rabbis would claim that they followed the law and a chief, the fanatics as well, and so perhaps we could hold one person responsible, even though the whole of the population were the ones who committed the crime, the crime of not intervening to prevent the assassination of an innocent man.</p>
<p>Those who sent the first Christians to the lion's den were also only following orders. Those who burnt the witches, those who martyred the protestants, as well as the Nazis at Auschwitz were also only following orders, as was the pilot of the plane carrying the bomb over Hiroshima, or the helicopter pilots who burnt the villages in Vietnam.</p>
<p>We all have a choice at every moment of our lives: remain responsible for our actions or become an irresponsible person. But the irresponsible are still responsible for their actions, and will one day have to account for them, for they are all committing crimes against Humanity.</p>
<p>Learn this by heart if you must, but refuse to obey a hierarchy which seeks to make you perform an action to which you would not like to be held responsible. The armed forces are the most dangerous example. It would be much better to die for having refused to kill, than to kill under the pretext of obeying orders. He who executes these monstrous orders is in fact more responsible than he who has given them.</p>
<p>No cause would justify the imposition of pain on others. If the survival of Humanity depended upon the pain inflicted on one man, a single non-violent man, then it would be better to let Humanity perish. Even more so if it means the survival of one's country, or rather a frontier arbitrarily traced on a globe which belongs to all men.</p>
<p>Absolute respect for this principle is the only way to prevent the imperceptible slipping of Humanity towards deresponsibilisation of individuals.</p>
<p>The following sentence should be ever-present in our minds: </p>
<p>'I am totally responsible for everything I do to others even if I am ordered to do so.'</p>
<p>'No cause could ever justify inflicting pain or death on a non-violent person, and even if the survival of Humanity depended on it, this would not justify an exception.' This is the second sentence which must be ever-present in our minds.</p>
<p>It is evident of course, that this rule does not apply in the case of legitimate self-defense, which is explained in the messages and which permits the possible overpowering, even by force, of one who tries to use violence against your person or your loved ones. If a military man was threatening the destruction of Humanity with nuclear missiles, it would then be justifiable to overpower him by force, and even to execute him if there were no other means available. Violence could only be applied to those who threaten Humanity with violence, while attempting to disarm them and render them powerless.</p>
<p>There is, however, a very good way to control those people who have the power when obeying orders to launch nuclear missiles capable of destroying cities in a few seconds. Their identity should be made known on a precise list, and they should be made aware, that in the case of the utilization of any such missiles, they would be judged along with those who gave the orders. This is what we are trying to do with Nazi criminals today; but if such a list had existed, with similar dispositions before 1939, many people would have thought twice before torturing their innocent victims.</p>
<p>Non-violent civilians should have the right to place neutral observers among the military forces, to note down the identities of those who carry out cruel acts using the excuse that they were obeying orders, so that inhuman missions are not carried out solely on the pretext that the order has been given. There is policing of the police, but there is no policing of the armies. They are free to command, knowing full well that while at war, a soldier could be shot to death for refusing to obey an order.</p>
<p>Until the Earth gets rid of the armies and the wars, the neutral observers would oppose the execution of soldiers who have refused orders that could qualify as crimes against Humanity. The UN could impose these observers on all the armies of the world, and then a military man could not be sentenced until his disobedience is judged by a council of these observers, to investigate if the order which he refused to obey could have constituted a crime against Humanity.</p>
<p>Because it is in this way that people are forced to execute orders of which they disapprove; they are afraid of being punished if they don't obey. They prefer to kill innocent people or to torture them, rather than be imprisoned or killed themselves. Refuse to bend to authority!</p>
<p>Be the real heroes of Humanity by preferring to be imprisoned or killed yourselves rather than laying into innocent people. When you have motivated millions of people so that they act in this way, those giving the orders will see an army of people refusing to carry out the crimes which they ordered, and then it will be time to punish those who dare give such orders, hoping they will be listened to.</p>
<p>Men have had enough energy to refuse non-unionized work, like before 1936, where the all-powerful bosses exploited humans like cattle, even if it meant death for many of them at the hands of a policeman, so-called &quot;protector of the law&quot;. It is possible to find the same energy to fight the last form of tyranny imposed on the inhabitants of this world: militarism.</p>
<p>Many people with powers and honors are disturbed by what I have to say. Unfortunately for them, they are too late in noticing my presence. If I was worried in the first two years of my mission, I am now no longer worried. In the beginning, if I had been sent to jail, I could not have carried out my mission on Earth. Fortunately, the powers at hand smiled when they saw this long-haired young man who spoke of flying-saucers and Martians with pink antennae... now they understand that the contents of the messages from our creators are revolutionary, questioning and uprooting everything which they have used to gain power: religion, politics, the armed forces, work, the family, the country, etc. So now they are trying to stop me by using their &quot;justice&quot; as they used it against my brother Jesus.</p>
<p>There is always a justice to justify the worst injustices. The first Christians were sentenced by official tribunals, the same for the burning of witches, or the sending of Jewish people to extermination camps, or the Soviet dissidents to psychiatric hospitals or labor camps; all those people were &quot;non-conformists&quot;, they were upsetting because they refused to be &quot;normal&quot; and conform. Unfortunately, they have woken up too late. Even if I were put in one of their prisons, there would still be thousands of messengers like you in many countries of the world, to carry the messages of our creators. I am no longer alone, I am 5,000 of you. I would then enter their cell with a smile, thinking of you, who, around the world, will be other Raels working together so that the embassy can be built, so that Humanity enters the Golden Age. </p>
<p>In my dungeon, i would feel the happiness of someone who has fulfilled his mission, that for which he has been created, and even though he has been put out of action, everything he has started continues to advance without him. Also hoping that my father who art in heaven will realize that i am no longer needed on this Earth, and that he will allow me to join my brothers, the prophets, on the planet of the Eternals.</p>
<p>This thought alone is sufficient to make me want to sing the glory of our fathers, to say again the words that men have been repeating without being able to understand: &quot;Alleluia! Alleluia!&quot; which means: &quot;Praised be Yahweh&quot; in Hebrew. Yes, praised be Yahweh who has given me the strength to carry out my mission until the end.</p>
<p>My Raelian brothers, i am now relaying to you the torch so that you can accomplish your mission. Even if the time when the truth will be triumphant is not here yet, you can rest assured that it is not very far, and you will have the opportunity to live it. It is written in <em>The Bible</em>: 'This generation will not pass that everything shall be revealed.'</p>
<p>These words are addressed to those who will have the opportunity to live this Age of Apocalypse, which we entered in 1945. You are this generation! Either you will know the Golden Age on Earth because of your efforts which have contributed to world peace and the awakening of Mankind, or Humanity will destroy itself and you will know the Golden Age amongst the great prophets who are already on the planet of the Eternals.</p>
<p>The Elohim are counting on each and every one of you to shed the light. My last word will again be an etymological demystification: &quot;Amen&quot;, which means in Hebrew: &quot;So be it!&quot;</p>
<p>And to those of you who are reading this book without having complete knowledge of the messages from our creators, be sure to read the other books as soon as possible, and then join us in making Humanity aware of them and in building the residence in which the Elohim will officially contact the governments of the Earth, where they will come in the company of the great prophets, Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed and others as the scriptures have announced.</p>
<p>Then write to me. I will personally answer your letter and indicate when and where you can have your cellular plan transmitted, your first action which recognizes the elohim as our creators, the name and address of your regional guide, and the dates when the next raelian courses of awakening will be held, which could make you a guide, an efficient messenger of our atheistic religion of the infinite, of blossoming, and of love for humanity.</p>
<p>Take your pen. Don't be the spectator of your life anymore!</p>
<p>Become actors on the stage of this sad, grey, and resigned everyday life that is yours, to enlighten it with a thousand shimmering colors of absolute consciousness.</p>
<p>Take a pen and paper and write to me very simply, and modestly with your everyday words, tell me if the discovery of the truth has been a shock for you. follow the impulse which came up inside of you and which said: 'Ah! It's not bad, but what will I be able to change, I am only one person, and then, what will the neighbors say?'</p>
<p>Don't hide your head in the sand, come out of the fragile shell that society has given you so freely! Your head is already sticking out, and it feels marvellous, but you are afraid that this will only be another illusion, a very short-lived pleasure, which would only bring you problems afterwards. untrue! live out completely the fantastic exaltation which you have felt. You will enter a new world, in which you will meet hundreds of people like you, who have read the messages in only one night, and who like you, have hesitated in getting involved in the diffusion of the messages. These people will help you by explaining how they have progressed, and you will find yourself filled with happiness, while seeing yourself through them, and while talking freely about your anxieties without the worry of being made a fool, since you are assured that the people around you share your conception of the universe: the conception that you had within you, although you never expressed your thoughts, for fear of being ridiculed.</p>
<p>Peter, one of our Guides, once said: 'One does not become a Raelian: one discovers that one always has been, when one discovers the messages.'</p>
<p>If you have discovered that you are a Raelian, then I am waiting for your letter, and the Elohim are waiting for you to drop it in the mailbox! My address is:</p>
