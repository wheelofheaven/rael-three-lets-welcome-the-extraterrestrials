<p>This chapter provides Rael's answers to those questions that were most
frequently raised by journalists during radio and television interviews
in which Rael participated worldwide in the years immediately following
the publication of his first two books in the mid-1970s.</p>
<h2 id="seeming-contradictions-between-the-first-and-second-message"><a class="header" href="#seeming-contradictions-between-the-first-and-second-message">Seeming Contradictions Between the First and Second Message</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The first contradiction which appeared between the first and second message was found in the beginning of the dialogue which took place between the Eloha and you. In the first message, when you asked him if it would be possible to visit his planet, he replied:</p>
<p>'No, you could not live there because the atmosphere is very different from yours, and you are not sufficiently prepared to support the journey.' Nevertheless, at the time of the second meeting on October 7th, 1975 (31), you were taken in one of their machines, and you spent nearly 24 hours on the planet of the Eternals.</p>
<p>We would remark that on the first contact, the machine appeared progressively, showing a flashing red light at about ten meters altitude  and descending slowly. When the machine was low enough for you to see the upper part, a strong white light was flashing on its top, whereas at the time of contact for the delivery of the second message, the machine appeared instantly behind the bushes at Roc Plat, without any flashing lights and at ground level. Also, when it returned, it disappeared instantly once you had descended from it, as if it had disintegrated.</p>
<p>Another contradiction: At the time of the first contact, the Eloha had his face surrounded by some sort of halo, which he later explained was a sort of space helmet composed of waves, whereas at the time of the most recent meeting, he had nothing surrounding his face. This contradiction is elsewhere strengthened by what is stated on page 30 in the first message: 'Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live', <em>Exodus 33:20,</em> and this biblical citation is explained thus: 'If man came on our planet, he would see the creators without their space helmets, but he would die because the atmosphere would not be suitable for him.' How do you explain this?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The explanation for these seeming contradictions is very simple and can be summarized in one word: psychology.</p>
<p>When one decides to come and make contact with a person living on a primitive planet, even though he was created to accomplish a very specific mission, there are certain precautions which must be taken so as not to irreversibly damage his psyche. To see a machine appearing in the sky equipped with flashing lights is not traumatic for a man living in a scientifically developed country of our time. He is more or less used to seeing satellites and rockets on TV and has already seen airplanes and helicopters since his childhood and understands, to some extent, how they operate. The best way to make an appearance without frightening him is to make a gradual approach with a machine equipped with flashing lights like his own airplanes and helicopters, well known to him.</p>
<p>Man would find that almost normal and would only be surprised at the absence of noise from a machine seemingly made of metal, and consequently very heavy. The being who appeared to him would have to be dressed in a way resembling how man expects present air pilots and astronauts to be dressed. The sort of space helmet covering the face would give him confidence, by reminding him of the pilots of Earth's flying machines with which he was well acquainted. Thus they would be able to reach their objective not to panic the person contacted, and at the same time allowing him to see technology which is still unknown to people on Earth, so that he will understand that he has discovered visitors from another planet.</p>
<p>At the time of the second encounter, when the flying machine appeared more brutally, the Elohim were using their technology without camouflage before a witness whom they knew was sufficiently prepared psychologically so as not to be traumatized. If they had appeared so brutally at the first encounter, the shock would have been too great, and my mental balance would have been too disturbed at that time, when I wasn't expecting anything. In spite of all their precautions, the nervous shock brought on the beginning of stomach ulcers, which took several months to heal. The message was &quot;sweet in my mouth, but bitter in my stomach&quot;. It would have been even more serious without the approach precautions which they took.</p>
<p>Up to our present day and age, our creators were only appearing while trying to impress their creation to the maximum, as incapable as they were to understand who these beings from the sky were. The Elohim's main objective was to make Man believe, even if they did not understand. Now that we are reaching the Age of Apocalypse, which means the &quot;Age of Revelation&quot;, that is to say, the age when everything can be understood, and not the &quot;end of the world&quot;, as some would like you to believe and as you can check in any dictionary, they have decided to appear while trying to be understood and recognized as our creators, those of which all the religious books of the Earth are talking, including <em>The Bible</em>, in which they are called the &quot;Elohim&quot;. This bible was dictated to the first human beings precisely with the aim to be recognized, now that millennia have passed and human knowledge has progressed sufficiently. In this way, we can look at what is coming from the sky without kneeling to pray and shouting &quot;miracle&quot;.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be remembered that the Elohim had decided to test me before giving me the complete message, so they went at it most progressively.</p>
<p>In spite of my insistent wish to take a trip in their vessel, they cut short my demands by stating that it was impossible for me to do so, just as people sometimes tell their children that if they drank alcohol they would stop growing. They added the example of the verse in <em>Exodus,</em> which they addressed to primitive men so that they would stay aloof. These primitives were meant to believe without, above all, trying to understand.</p>
<h2 id="dating-the-works-of-the-elohim"><a class="header" href="#dating-the-works-of-the-elohim">Dating the Works of the Elohim</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The Elohim said they created life on Earth 25,000 years ago. How is it that we find traces of animal bones as old as many hundreds of thousands of years?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The Elohim have explained that they did not create our planet.</p>
<p>When they decided to pursue their experiments of creating life scientifically in a laboratory, they set out to search the universe for a planet which would have a suitable atmosphere, allowing them to work easily. The Earth proved to be positive after many tests and analyzes.</p>
<p>Then they came down to our planet and created the life forms we now know, including humans. It doesn't mean, that 10,000 or 20,000 years before their arrival, there wasn't another creation on Earth that could have been destroyed by a natural or an artificial catastrophe.</p>
<p>Imagine that an atomic war breaks out tomorrow, and all life on Earth is destroyed. Then 10,000 years later, extra-terrestrials settle down to create new living organisms, intelligent beings who would discover traces of our civilization after a slow scientific progression; these same beings would find it hard to believe that beings coming from the sky had created them scientifically, using as proof the bones which they found to be older than 25,000 years, our bones! They might even find the far older bones of mammoths that we ourselves still find existing in the debris of our time because the life that exists on Earth at present is not the first one to be created, and it won't be the last.</p>
<p>There has been an infinity of creations on our planet, but also an infinity of destructions, due for the most part to a lack of wisdom by those who were the equivalent to our humanity.</p>
<h2 id="the-people-of-israel-and-the-jews"><a class="header" href="#the-people-of-israel-and-the-jews">The People of Israel and the Jews</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>In the first message, on page 18, it is written that the people of Israel were elected at one of the Elohim's competitions, as the most successful humanoids as far as intelligence and genius are concerned.</p>
<p>Then in the second message on page 170, it is written 'The Jews are our direct descendants on Earth. That is why a special destiny is reserved for them. They are the descendants of the 'Sons of Elohim and the daughters of men', as written in <em>Genesis</em>. Is this not contradictory? </p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The people who were chosen by our creators, the Elohim, as being the most accomplished, were the people of Israel, who had been created in a laboratory at this location on our planet. It is perhaps because these people were the greatest success that the Sons of the Elohim were tempted by their females and had children by them, from whom the Jewish people descend. That is how the race populating the soil of Israel became the Jewish people.</p>
<h2 id="the-raelian-movement-and-money"><a class="header" href="#the-raelian-movement-and-money">The Raelian Movement and Money</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>In the first book, it is written on page 86:</p>
<p>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth... No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve Yahweh and mammon. <em>Matthew 6: 19-24.</em></p>
<p>And the Vatican is vigorously attacked for its riches, while the Raelian Movement is asking for money from its members. Is it not falling into the same trap as the Vatican?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>One must not compare those who live in luxury and opulence, recommending their faithful to live poorly, and who use these poorpeople's money to maintain a myriad of bishops and cardinals, toincrease continually their real estate investments, to maintain a palaceof another era with guards wearing halberds; one must not compare these Roman usurpers with a movement that has not, nor will ever have, a paid clergy: that had not, nor will ever own three-quarters of the houses and real estate in a capital where people are having problems finding suitable lodgings, as is the case in Rome, where they refuse to rent to whoever it may be for fear of devaluation of the investment; that has not, and never will have a princely palace crumbling under the heaviness of gold and silver.</p>
<p>We have indeed a need for a lot of money, but it will be used to attain these precise objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Translate the messages of the Elohim into every language, and bring them to the attention of all the peoples of the Earth.</li>
<li>Build an embassy where the Elohim will be able to meet men officially. This embassy will be neither a princely palace nor a cathedral, but rather a simple house possessing the comforts to which all modern men are entitled, with the kind of diplomatic immunity that even the smallest state has for its embassy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, if by good fortune, we succeed in obtaining more money than we need to realize the first two objectives that I have already pointed out, and in such a short space of time that we have not yet managed the diffusion of the message all over the planet, we will then use the excess money to build a research centre near the embassy. This centre will bring together all the scientists who wish to work on the creation of life in a laboratory, allowing Mankind to equal their creators. The creation of biological robots will allow the elimination of work and consequently money. Also, we plan to build a school for the geniuses and the gifted. These research teams will be able to work freely, outside the exploiting laboratories, the multinational trusts and the suffocation of geniuses by state systems.</p>
<p>In this way they will have the opportunity to work without fear of seeing their inventions fall into the hands of politico-military powers, seeking to use new discoveries to build ever more destructive armaments.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-is-constant-in-space-and-time"><a class="header" href="#nothing-is-constant-in-space-and-time">Nothing is Constant in Space and Time</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>In the first book on page 89, you wrote that the planet of the Elohim is a little less than a light year away, that being the distance that light can travel in one year, or nine thousand billion kilometers, since light moves at about three hundred thousand kilometers per second. Our present day scientists state that the closest star outside our sun is located four light years away. How do you explain the difference?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The Elohim do not want us to know exactly where their planet is located. This is quite understandable when we consider man's persistence towards destruction, even though the level of technology on Earth is still fairly primitive.</p>
<p>That will all be revealed in more detail when they will officially arrive in the embassy that we will build for them. In the meantime, we can only ask questions.</p>
<p>Scientific members of our movement have put forth an hypothesis: the distance between their planet and ours could be about four light years by following the light, which could be moving in a pronounced curve, but would only be one light year away if we travelled in a straight line. That is a possibility.</p>
<p>I might add that light does not move at the same speed in all strata of the universe, because nothing is invariable, neither in space nor time. This is one of the biggest errors that present scientists are committing. They start with an observation based on a limited period of time to draw conclusions bearing on the past thousands of years and on the time to come, or they base conclusions on a limited space, to draw conclusions on the infinity of space. Man has always made the same mistake of judging according to his knowledge. Those who used the horizon as a base reasoned that the Earth had to be flat. </p>
<p>This is also true for historical dating, such as the methods based on radioactivity named &quot;Carbon 14&quot;, potassium-argon, uranium-lead-thorium or all other such methods. There exists a very interesting book which explains all of this very seriously for the scientists who might be interested: I am referring to <em>Evolution or Creation</em> (see bibliography at the end of this book). In short, the error in these dating methods is to start with the principle that the present atomic movement has always been the same, and starting from there, to make calculations based on false information, because nothing is invariable in the universe in time or in space.</p>
<p>To illustrate this error, let's take a 25 year old human, for example, and measure his growth in one year, about one millimeter is a good average for most subjects. Starting from there, we could establish that the man is 1,750 years old, because he measures 1.75 meters. We would forget that the growth of this young man has never been invariable. The first year, he grew more than 500 millimeters (since conception), between four and five years only 60 millimeters, between seven and eight years only 30 millimeters, but between 14  and 15 years another 80 millimeters! As you will see, nothing is constant, all efforts to determine the subject's age, starting from a partial observation of his growth, would be a total failure. One could note that if we started at 60 centimeters in the first year of growth, to estimate the age of the person, in 21 years of such growth, we could predict that this individual would measure 12.6 meters at age 21. </p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>In the first book on page 13, you wrote that the Elohim had created the original continent 25,000 years ago, from which fragments later detached to form the continents we now know. The merican continent continued to separate itself from Europe by a few entimeters each year according to certain scientists, or by a metre ach year as others claim. Be that as it may, even if it is one metre er year, in twenty-five thousand years, we will reach 25,000 meters or 25 kilometers, but the North American continent is many thousands of kilometers away from Europe. How can this be explained?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The reply to this question is exactly the same as to the previous question. In the growth pattern of a human being, the relation between the first year and the 21st year is 600 to one. It is a thousand times greater when we speak of the separation of the continents.</p>
<p>Here again nothing is invariable neither in time nor space.</p>
<p>Actually, the continents separate only a few centimeters each year perhaps, but in the beginning, they separated by many hundreds of kilometers each year.</p>
<p>Recently there occurred an earthquake near the Arabian peninsula, and people were surprised to note that a fault was created, separating two regions by a metre in only one night.</p>
<p>And yet we are in a relatively calm period of the Earth's history, the side effects of &quot;the storm&quot; of the creation of the original continent by our Fathers have had time to calm down in 25 millennia. In the infinity of time and space, nothing is invariable, not in matter, not in energy.</p>
<h2 id="transmission-of-the-cellular-plan-and-the-forehead-bone"><a class="header" href="#transmission-of-the-cellular-plan-and-the-forehead-bone">Transmission of the Cellular Plan and the Forehead Bone.</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>It is asked of all those who recognize Rael as having been sent by our creators, the Elohim, and being the last of the prophets, to have their cellular plan transmitted by him, or by a Guide qualified to officiate by him, all this so that the genetic code of each Raelian may be preserved, so as to permit an eventual re-creation on the planet of the Eternals. On the other hand, each Raelian is also asked to take the necessary precautions in his or her will, so that the forehead bone be sent to the Guide of Guides after his or her death; to what will that avail, since the transmission of the cellular plan has already taken place?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The transmission of the cellular plan is a recognition of the Elohim as being our creators, performed by each Raelian while still alive. The conservation of the forehead bone is a recognition of the Elohim as being our creators, even after death. Together they constitute a recognition &quot;in life as in death&quot;. The cellular plan or genetic code of each individual is registered in an enormous computer which records all our actions during our life, from the time of our conception, from the meeting of the ovule and the spermatozoon, the moment when a new genetic code is registered, hence a new individual. This individual will be followed throughout his lifetime, and at the end of his life, the computer will know if he has the right to eternal life on the planet where the Elohim accept only the most conscious of men and women.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>What happens to a Raelian who dies in an accident and whose body is completely destroyed?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>If the Raelian in question has taken precautions in his will, asking that his forehead bone be sent to the Guide of Guides, there is no problem, since it will be registered by the computer which surveys every one of us during the whole of our existence. In the same way, there is no problem for the Raelians who die without the authorities respecting their last will and testament, by refusing the removal of the said forehead bone. What is important is that each Raelian make his or her will known in the manner asked.</p>
<p>When there will be millions of Raelians, the government will be forced to see that their last will and testament are respected by law.</p>
<p>The last will and testament of the first Christians were not respected either, so long as they were in a minority. Raelism will be the dominant religion in the world of the third millennium, and then the last will and testament of all Raelians will be respected.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The majority of people die old. Are they re-created old, and will they live eternally old?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>Obviously not! A person who is fortunate in being re-created to live eternally on the planet of the Eternals is re-created young with a body in full possession of its force and its resources. At each recreation, they will be re-created the same way eternally.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>It is written that only those who follow you will be saved. If a person has had a life turned towards happiness and the blossoming of humanity, but has never heard of the messages of the Elohim, has that person no chance of being saved?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>This person is among the just and will be saved. That part of the messages concerns those who have read the messages. Among them, only those who have decided to follow the rules given by our creators will be saved. But if there are people on Earth who live in seeking above all to help the progress of humanity, or to help their fellow men to the most of their ability, and who die without having known the messages of our Fathers, they will be among the just and will be saved. It will be more pardonable for those who do not know about the messages and who act positively than for those who know of them, because the latter have no excuse not to have changed their conduct or to have paid even more attention to their actions.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-earth-an-atom-of-the-finger-of-god"><a class="header" href="#is-the-earth-an-atom-of-the-finger-of-god">Is the Earth an Atom of the Finger of God?</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The message explains that our planet is but an atom of an atom of the gigantic being of which we are just a part, just as there is intelligent life in the atoms of the atoms of which we are composed.</p>
<p>But the great being of which we are only a part, could it not be considered as &quot;God&quot;?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>It all depends on what we mean by the word <em>God</em>. If we are thinking of Infinity, then yes, but only in part; because this gigantic being of which we are only a part, also lives on a planet which is an atom of another gigantic being and so on to infinity.</p>
<p>If we mean by &quot;God&quot; a being having power over us, not at all, because there is no such &quot;God&quot;.</p>
<p>The infinitely great being of which the Earth is but an atom, has no power over us, because one must not forget that for that being, time passes much more slowly. The time it takes for that being to think of something, for us a few millennia have passed. The time taken for beings who live on one of the atoms of our atoms to think of something, is for us, a billionth of a billionth of a second. This infinitely small being could think that we are &quot;God&quot;, and would be just as wrong as us if we considered the being that we are a part of to be something divine. The universe being infinite, there can be no centre, which eliminates the possibility of the existence of an all-powerful and omnipresent God!</p>
<p>The Infinite is omnipresent, and we are a part of it as it is a part of us. But it has no power over us, and it is &quot;infinitely&quot; indifferent to our decisions or our behavior. After all, there is nothing to prove that the great being of whose particles we are the parasites, is human. It is perhaps a dog or a worm (the only thing that could be proven by the Elohim is that it is something alive).</p>
<h2 id="noahs-ark----a-space-craft"><a class="header" href="#noahs-ark----a-space-craft">Noah's Ark -- A Space Craft?</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The messages state that Noah's Ark was a spaceship. However, there was a discovery a few years ago in a glacier on Mount Ararat of the remains of a boat, which some claimed to be the debris from Noah's Ark which, it would appear, was a boat. How do you explain that?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The pieces of wood which were found have recently been analyzed, and it was estimated they were not older than seven hundred years, which would put Noah's Ark at around AD1200. Even if we admit that the dating system makes enormous errors, and that one</p>
<p>multiplies the dating by three, one would obtain two thousand years, which would place the flood at the beginning of the Christian era, which makes no sense. Even if one day the remains of a wooden boat were found dating back about five thousand years, which would correspond with the period of the flood, that would not prove that Noah's Ark was a wooden boat. One would certainly find near Mount Ararat pieces of a wooden boat dating back to the epoch of the true flood, because at the time when Noah built his spaceship destined to save certain humans from destruction, there were in the ports of his country some wooden boats, which had been carried by the enormous tidal waves at the time of the huge explosions responsible for the destruction of all life on Earth. Just as today we can find in Florida, not far from the modern American rocket-site which carried the astronauts to the Moon, some magnificent sailing boats constructed with wood, and superb yachts belonging to American millionaires.</p>
<p>In the case of an atomic war, certain explosions could activate enormous tidal waves, which would carry away the boats to the tops of the closest mountains, like pieces of straw. The eventual survivors could, on finding the debris of those boats some centuries later, deduce that there must have been an enormous flood to carry them there; and, since certain writings report that some humans had been saved from this flood, having been protected on board a vessel, they would be certain that these would be the vessels in question.</p>
<p>There is a very important point which helps us to understand clearly that the flood was not the result of a continual rainfall as is generally thought, but the result of a colossal cataclysm, having completely, and in a very brutal manner, overturned the surface of the Earth. If it had been caused by continual rain, all the boats would have been saved, and of course all the sailors and navigators of that epoch would have survived without the least problem. Now it is clearly written that only those who were in Noah's Ark survived, which makes sense, it being the only spaceship!</p>
<h2 id="life-after-life----or-dream-and-reality"><a class="header" href="#life-after-life----or-dream-and-reality">Life After Life -- or Dream and Reality?</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>A book was published recently which related the testimonies of people who were brought back to life after having been in a coma, and nearly all of them told the same story of the visions they had as death approached -- a vision of harmonious people wearing white robes and singing, a vision of people who had disappeared, etc. You claim that after death there is nothing if the Elohim do not intervene to re-create those who die. How do you explain this consistency in testimony, and does it not prove the existence of a soul?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>All that happens in the human brain is but the result of electro-chemical reactions. Be it of love, of hate, of pleasure, of suffering, of imagination, or all other states of mind, sentiment or sickness; the process depends in every case on the chemical reactions produced in the interior of the brain, and the resulting electrical impulses or messages, be they visual, auditory, based on memory, or an interpretation of new events based on elements that one has in the memory.</p>
<p>When we breathe very deeply and rapidly, we feel elated very soon, and if we make one hundred people do the same thing, their experience will all be consistent. If we make one hundred people run one kilometer, they will all be out of breath. Every given phenomenon corresponds to a given physical reaction, which will be the same for everyone. When an individual falls into a coma, the brain is irrigated by the blood in a certain manner, and the brain cells are thus oxygenated in a certain way, and these chemical facts produce certain reactions which are about the same for all of us.</p>
<p>If we place acid on limestone, it will always make a foam. If we hit the heads of one hundred people strong enough for them to fall into a coma, they will all have the impression of having seen the same thing. Indeed, they would describe only that which was stored in their memory of the chemical reactions to which they were subjected.</p>
<p>It is a bit like when we dream. Nobody would think of saying that because he met 10 other people who all dreamt that they were being chased by a bull that was 10 meters high and spitting flames, that since many people reported the same thing, these sorts of bulls must exist. We have all dreamt, at one time or another, that we could fly, just by giving a little push with our feet; but no one seriously believes that this proves that they can fly around with the swallows, or that such a thing would be possible, because thousands of people have had the same dream. One must not interpret these dreams as reality, even if science endeavors to realize them technically, by building an apparatus one day which really allows us to fly. Something which all of those who were in a coma remember well, is that they were not anxious to return to their body, and this is really not surprising. It would be more accurate to say that they had no desire to be conscious of their body again, just as when we come out of a very sweet dream in the company of the opposite sex, for example, and we try to go back to sleep to recapture the happiness which we experienced.</p>
<p>The fact that all ex-comatose people describe almost the same experience proves that identical chemical reactions were produced in the human brain, hence their reactions to electrical phenomena are also identical. If we implant electrodes in 1,000 human brains, in exactly the same locations, and we send them an identical electrical charge, they will all feel the same thing and have the same visions.</p>
<p>This is exactly what happens at the time of death. If certain privileged people deserve re-creation on the planet of the Eternals after their death, this will happen only when total death has occurred, and nothing will happen so long as the person is in a coma, therefore alive.</p>
<h2 id="the-elohims-scientific-level-of-development"><a class="header" href="#the-elohims-scientific-level-of-development">The Elohim's Scientific Level of Development</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>There does not seem to be as great a time-lag as one would expect between our creators and us, even though they are 25,000 years ahead of us. Their slow progression gives us the impression that we will be able to accomplish the same things in much less time. How is that?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>In order to report what I have seen, I used words that people of today can understand, while placing myself psychologically at the level of the most numerous of those who live in technologically developed countries. In fact, we cannot even begin to imagine the capacity and the technological level of the Elohim. What we are doing at the end of the 20th century of the Christian era would seem miraculous to Europeans who lived only 100 years ago, as well as to the Amazon Indians now living in their forests, but what our creators can do would seem equally miraculous to our most advanced  scientists, if they were showing it to them. Normally, the Elohim will not do it because they don't want to place us in a state of incomprehension that would inevitably lead to giving value back to beliefs that generate primitive religions. In this way, the Elohim hope that we will continue, above all, to seek to understand matter and the forces which surround us, by ourselves.</p>
<p>In the same manner in which they appeared to me with flashing lights and a sort of space suit so as not to disorientate me too much at the beginning, while they are able to appear instantly at ground level as they did at the meeting at Roc Plat, they could also show humanity technological prowess that even the most imaginative scientists could not understand by themselves.</p>
<p>They are capable of doing certain things with infinitely large particles such as planets and even entire solar systems, which we still find hard to do with infinitely small particles such as neutrons or electrons. What I mean is that they are able to modify the movements of planets within solar systems, and even displace some entire solar systems. They are able to do all this by using waves which we are not even aware of yet.</p>
<p>Let's go back to what was written in the first two messages. We must admit that between our present level of science on Earth and the mastery of scientific re-creation allowing eternal life, for example, there is a giant step that our scientists will take a long time to make, even if it is not entirely inconceivable for the most open-minded of them.</p>
<h2 id="neither-god-nor-soul-but-the-elohim-and-the-genetic-code"><a class="header" href="#neither-god-nor-soul-but-the-elohim-and-the-genetic-code">Neither God nor Soul, but the Elohim and the Genetic Code</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>It is written in the messages that there is no God since the universe, being infinite in space, could have no centre, and there is no soul for much the same reasons. But could it not be said that the Elohim replace &quot;God&quot; in the minds of many Raelians, and that the possibility of being re-created on the planet of the Eternals, replaces the idea of a &quot;soul&quot;, allowing access to &quot;paradise&quot;?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>Yes, there is no &quot;God&quot;. The universe is infinite and therefore cannot have a centre by definition because of it being infinite.</p>
<p>However, it is necessary to differentiate between those for whom &quot;God&quot; is a concept meaning infinity, something eternal, omnipresent, impalpable, and having no power over man and those for whom &quot;God&quot; is a being with a white beard sitting on a cloud who created humans in his image.</p>
<p>Since the beginning, there has been a conglomeration between two concepts, between two totally different things, that were unjustly put together under the same label. The Elohim explained to the first humans that on the one hand, there is Infinity, which is omnipresent and eternal and of which we are a part and which is part of us, and on the other hand, themselves, the Elohim, who created us in their image.</p>
<p>Little by little the properties of the Infinite were affiliated to the Elohim, and this is partly true because they are eternal; and to the Infinite, the power of manifestation through Celestial Messengers, is partly true again, because in a certain way, the Elohim could be considered as the instrument of the Infinite in their creation of intelligent beings in their image.</p>
<p>But the Infinite does not constantly watch over us directly and in itself is not conscious of our individual behavior. Whether mankind reaches the Golden Age or self-destructs is of no importance to the Infinite, no more than us paying attention to the molecule of our fingers which we leave on a fabric when we touch it. In relation to the Infinite, it is quite normal that there would be a natural selection at all levels, the same as for the man or the dog of which the Earth is but an atom of its skull or finger nail, and the same for the sun which illuminates it, or for the billions of inhabited planets that can be found in our thumb-nail.</p>
<p>Those who think of &quot;God&quot; as Infinity, as most oriental religions teach, are right, in as much as it represents a concept without identity, and without consciousness of our own existence, or any other for that matter.</p>
<p>Those for whom &quot;God&quot; is our creators, the Elohim, are not entirely wrong either, so long as they do not think of them as beings who must be worshiped on hands and knees or lying down with one's face in the dirt, but of elder brothers in the Infinite, whom we should love as we wish to be loved by the beings that we will create one day.</p>
<p>The spirit is a concept, whose etymology we will trace so as to better understand its meaning. The word <em>spirit</em> comes from the Latin <em>spirare</em> which means &quot;to breathe&quot; and the word <em>soul</em> comes from the same root as the French word <em>souffle</em>, also meaning &quot;breath&quot;. We can analyze the exact composition of the human body, then mix together all the chemical constituents, but we will not obtain a living being for all that. Something will be missing, something which is needed to assemble, to articulate, to organize it in a well defined plan. Take all that is required to build the house of your dreams, such as 10 tons of stones, a ton of cement, 100 kilos of paint, two wash basins, a bath, etc., and put it all in a heap. Nevertheless, we would not obtain a house because the most important thing is missing: the plan. The creation of a person follows the same principle, there has to be a plan.</p>
<p>This plan is the genetic code, which means that by assembling a minute quantity of matter to form the first cell containing a cellular plan, we would consider that person is, in fact, nearly completed.</p>
<p>This first cell would use the matter we give it as food to multiply in two, then four, then eight cells, and so on, following a precise plan until all the information contained in the genetic specifications has been met.</p>
<p>Each and every living being possesses a genetic code, which differs according to the species, or depending on individuals belonging to the same species, in certain details, such as the color of the eyes, the hair, the character, etc. Even <em>The Bible</em> states clearly that each living being possesses a &quot;soul&quot; and not only man:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But flesh with the soul thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the soul of man. <em>Genesis 9: 4-5</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the soul of the flesh is in the blood. <em>Leviticus 17: 11</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, there is no ethereal soul flying gracefully from the body after death, but there is the genetic code, which is the personality of each individual. It is through this genetic code that the Elohim proceed to re-create those people whose life on Earth is worthy of eternal life on their planet.</p>
<p>There is no &quot;God&quot;, but there are the Elohim, our creators who we wish to welcome as they deserve to be welcomed, and in whom we have faith, or rather trust. Also, there is no autonomous soul flying from the body after death, but there is the genetic code which allows access to eternal life.</p>
<h2 id="the-religion-of-the-infinite"><a class="header" href="#the-religion-of-the-infinite">The Religion of the Infinite</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The Raelian Movement is an atheist religion whose goals are the diffusion of the messages of demystification, given by the Elohim, to the Earth's population, and to build an embassy where they will make official contact with the governments of the Earth. Supposing that humanity showed proof of wisdom and succeeded in avoiding self-destruction, that the messages would be diffused in every language, that the embassy is built and that the Elohim arrive; what will be the function of the Raelian religion then, and what will its mission be?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>If all that comes about, and I am of the opinion that it will, even if there is only one chance in a hundred that man will choose the path of wisdom, humanity's religion will become that of the Elohim -- the Infinite. The mission of the Raelian Guides will then be the teaching of the techniques allowing man to live in harmony with the Infinite.</p>
<p>These techniques are summarily explained in <em>The Keys</em> in the second message and in <em>Sensual Meditation</em>. In other words, all of that which enables man to raise his level of consciousness, to refine his perception of the electro-chemical reactions and interchanges produced
in his brain.</p>
<p>The religion of the Infinite is the religion of the absolute, and it is inevitably eternal. The mere fact that people, 25,000 years ahead of us scientifically, are still faithful to this religion, is the proof that this is the absolute religion, the eternal religion for all the living species who have reached a universal level of consciousness, that is to say Infinite.</p>
<p>The awakening sessions that we organize regularly constitute an approach to this religion of the Infinite through sensual meditation.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-traditional-religions"><a class="header" href="#the-future-of-traditional-religions">The Future of Traditional Religions</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>If the Elohim come to the embassy accompanied by Moses, Jesus, Buddha, and Mohammed, and all the great prophets who live on the planet of the Eternals, what will become of the existing religions?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The majority would rally to the Raelian Movement, at least those churchgoers who are faithful to the writings of these religions, and who are sufficiently intelligent and open-minded enough to understand. Unfortunately, a great number of narrow minded fanatics, guided by the clergy of these religions afraid of losing their source of revenue, will oppose the general rally. They will allege that the Elohim are usurpers, or that they have been sent by &quot;the devil&quot;, and facing their own Christ, they would joyfully crucify him again, just as the clergy of the Inquisition would have burned Jesus as a sorcerer in his own name if he had had the misfortune to fall into their hands in that epoch.</p>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to have breakfast with one of the representatives of the Jewish community in Montreal, Quebec.</p>
<p>During the meal, I asked him what he would do if Moses himself told him to do otherwise than that which is written in <em>The Old Testament</em>.</p>
<p>He replied: 'I would continue to apply that which is written in <em>The Bible</em>.'</p>
<p>Many people are like him, and this is one of the problems with which the Elohim are confronted as they seek recognition from humanity. They will have to be stronger than the beliefs that they have engendered.</p>
<p>If tomorrow the Elohim landed somewhere in the world and explained to the governors who came to meet them, and to the media, that &quot;God&quot; does not exist, nor the soul, and presented Jesus in the flesh, saying who he is, do you believe that the Vatican would place its fortune at his disposal? Certainly not, because the system has taken the upper hand over the fundamental goals of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>All nuns are the wives of Jesus. Would they place themselves at his service if he returned? To be the wives of someone who does not exist materially, believing that he is alive somewhere, and being worried if he really returned: that is the problem of the nuns.</p>
<p>As a great thinker once said: we cannot change the minds of people, they simply die and are replaced by others more evolved who have
a different opinion. Time is on our side.</p>
<p>Certainly there will always be a small nucleus of narrow-minded fanatics, but they will die out, the same as the pre-Christian religions who martyred the first Christians, and whose beliefs have nevertheless totally disappeared.</p>
<p>The problem only will arise if the Elohim arrive before the present primitive beliefs have totally disappeared.</p>
<h2 id="raelism-and-geniocracy"><a class="header" href="#raelism-and-geniocracy">Raelism and Geniocracy</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>You published a book entitled: <em>Geniocracy</em>, from which a political movement was formed called: The Movement for Worldwide</p>
<p>Geniocracy. Are you not trying to use a religious movement to impose a political doctrine?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>Many Raelians were particularly interested by the chapter in the first message, which explained what the political organization was like on the planet of the Elohim, and asked me to develop this idea in a manifesto which would help them to create a political movement following this ideology. The fact that the Elohim wanted us to favor the implantation of geniocracy on Earth, and at the same time, leave men free to understand something better if they could, prompted me to agree to write this manifesto. Later, the few Raelians more particularly interested in geniocracy, created the party in question, and even presented a candidate at an election only a few months after its creation.</p>
<p>My position is very clear in all the countries where geniocracy is progressing. I am on Earth primarily to accomplish my mission, which consists of spreading the messages of our creators and building the embassy that they have requested. Those who are involved with geniocracy know that I devote all my time to my mission, and that even though I wish them the best of results, I do not feel concerned with their problems. I have even asked all the Guides who have started these political movements to find, as quickly as possible, other non-Raelians capable of replacing them, so that the Guides in question can devote themselves to that which, in my opinion, is more important: their work
as Guides.</p>
<p>If geniocratic candidates do seek to be elected, I will always advise the Raelians to vote for them. It becomes quite evident that a person can be a Raelian and a &quot;Geniocrat&quot;, just as one can be a Democrat and a Christian; one can have a religion and a political opinion.</p>
<p>Raelians do not have to get involved with the Geniocratic party, in fact, quite the contrary. I am convinced that people can do only one thing at a time, at least very well, so I advise Raelians not to become active in the Geniocratic party, but to leave that to non-Raelians.</p>
<p>When one works eight hours a day and spends all one's free time diffusing the messages, each free moment becomes precious. Not a single minute should be wasted on a political movement when it could be spent diffusing the messages. One must make a choice, and a political ideology does not weigh very much when compared with the messages of the Elohim. I have set the ball rolling with geniocracy, and I am now counting on non-Raelians to run it. Perhaps it will develop into something enormous which will save humanity, or perhaps humanity will save itself without geniocracy, even if they come to it later. The only important thing is that the embassy will soon be built; this is my only concern, my only preoccupation, and it should be the only concern and the only preoccupation of all true Raelians. The priority of priorities is the building of the embassy for our creators, so that we can welcome them in the company of the ancient messengers: Moses, Jesus, Buddha, and Mohammed. This is my only reason for being on this Earth. This must become the only reason for living for all those people who wish to help me.</p>
<h2 id="who-created-the-creator-of-the-creators"><a class="header" href="#who-created-the-creator-of-the-creators">Who Created the Creator of the Creators?</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The Elohim created us, and other people from another planet created them. Who created the creators of the Elohim?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The Infinite in space is easier for man to understand than the Infinite in time.</p>
<p>Once we have attained sufficient open-mindedness, we can understand that in space the Earth is but a particle of the atom of the atoms of the hand of a gigantic being, who contemplates a starlit sky which composes the hand, the stomach or the foot of a being even more gigantic, who finds himself under a sky, etc., etc., ad infinitum.</p>
<p>The same process applies for the infinitely small. On the atom of the atoms of our hands, there exist intelligent beings for whom these particles are planets and stars, and these beings are composed of atoms of which the particles are the stars and the planets on which there are intelligent beings, etc., etc., also to infinity.</p>
<p>Infinity in time becomes more difficult for Man to understand because Man is born one day, he lives a certain number of years and dies, but he would like everything in the universe to be limited in time as he is. For the man who is not awakened, the idea that anything in the universe could be eternal is unbearable, even if this were the universe itself. Our present day scientists abide by the same rule and say the universe must measure so many kilometers and must be so many millions of years old. Whether in space or in time, we can only measure the part of the universe that we can sense.</p>
<p>Everything is eternal, be it in the form of matter or energy, and we ourselves are composed of eternal matter.</p>
<p>The Elohim were created by people from another planet, who had been created by other people coming from another planet, and so on to
Infinity.</p>
<p>It is as foolish to search for the beginning of the universe in time as it is to search for the beginning of space.</p>
<p>Let us get back to the example where intelligent beings are living on the particle of one of the atoms of our hand and for whom this particle is a planet. In relation to space, the scientists on this microscopic planet located, for example, in the middle of the bone marrow of the first phalanx of our right index finger, these scientists will at first claim that the other particles that they can observe with the naked eye revolve around the centre of their world, their planet, the particle on which they are located. For these scientists, it is obvious that their planet is the centre of the universe. But they will progress, and one day a genius will prove that their sun does not revolve around their planet, and that the stars also do not revolve around their little world, but rather it is their planet that turns on itself in a near motionless sky, as well as turning around their sun at the same time. He will probably be burnt for his heretical theories by the inquisitorial witch-hunters of their &quot;particle planet&quot;, but a day will come when people, having discovered more sophisticated instruments of observation, will prove that he was right.</p>
<p>Then the learned scientists of that period will proceed to measure the universe, in all modesty, saying that it stretches from the farthest star particle located at one end of the sky to the farthest star particle located at the other end. This measurement will represent only one billionth of a billionth of the area of our finger where they happen to be located. But, since they cannot see any further, they will assume that the universe stops where they can no longer observe.</p>
<p>But the observation techniques will progress even more, and they will start to perceive that there are other galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Be that as it may, it will prove only that the universe is greater than had been anticipated, and it will always measure so many thousand kilometers or light-years, a little more than before, 10 or 100 times more eventually, nevertheless, it will always measure something.
We have reached this point in our progression on Earth.</p>
<p>But let us get back to the planet located on our finger.</p>
<p>Science is always progressing, and the inhabitants of our phalanx are now at the level to launch always more audacious space explorations. They finally reach a new frontier, the bone of which their planet is but an atom of an atom. This way they can be sure that the universe measures so much by so much. The proof is that, after that point, there is nothing more to be observed.</p>
<p>A little later they succeed in crossing the immensity which separates the bone from the muscle, and their universe gains new dimensions again.</p>
<p>They improve their space-ships and finally reach the layer of skin which covers our finger. They have reached the end of their universe, which measures one-and-a-half centimeters by our scale, but was many light-years for them.</p>
<p>They will still be able, however, to pursue their space explorations inside the rest of our body. They will follow certain currents where the stars are moving mysteriously at very high speeds - gigantic corridors, which they will chart to permit them to come and go freely from their planet, but little will they know that they are travelling in our blood vessels. Their universe will be measured, demarcated. It will have a particular height, width and depth. An incredible number of light-years on their scale but only 1.75 meters for us. They will not yet have discovered that our feet, for example, are standing on a planet which for them is itself made up of a great number of galaxies, which their narrow minds, always wanting to place frontiers everywhere, cannot even begin to imagine and grasp. For the quantity of atoms contained within the Earth is immeasurable compared with the number within our body.</p>
<p>They would also have to become conscious that there are other &quot;universe-men&quot; like us, who are walking on this planet, and that in our sky there are other stars and other galaxies, and so on to Infinity.</p>
<p>Only some of the wisest of them, having reached a superior level of consciousness allowing them to be in tune with the universe, will thus be able to teach all this to their disciples at a time where, for the official scientists, their universe measured only a millionth of a millionth of a millimeter of the bone of our finger, which they could observe, only from the inside...</p>
<p>The concept of Infinity in time is the very same thing. The scientists of that mini-world could measure the age of their universe by measuring the age of the molecule of which their planet is but an atom of an atom, and the universe would have that age. Then they would realize that the age of the cell of which the molecule that they thought to be the &quot;total universe&quot;, while it was, in fact, only a part, is much greater. Then they would discover that the limb, of which this cell is but a part, is much older still, and that the age of the being of which this member is but a part, is even greater, and so on to infinity. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-life"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-purpose-of-life">What is the Purpose of Life?</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>What is the purpose of life?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>As stated in the messages, everything must be estimated in relation to four levels. Our life means nothing when compared with the Infinite. If we die, if all of humanity disappears, it will not change anything in the Infinity of time or space. The gigantic being of whom we are a parasite of a particle of an atom, will continue to exist without noticing anything, and the whole of the history of mankind since its creation will have only lasted a billionth of a second for him.</p>
<p>The living beings on the atoms of the atoms of our hand will continue to exist as if nothing had happened, even if the atom on which their universe is located, is buried deep in the Earth in the flow of blood coming from our finger torn away by an explosion, for example. Even if this drop of blood is swallowed by a worm that retains the atom in which their universe is located, to constitute new cells for its growth, this will not affect the living beings on this little world, any more than it would affect the beings living on the atoms which make up the cells of their own fingers...</p>
<p>In relation to the Elohim, our life is very important, because we are their children, and we must show them that we are proud of having been privileged enough to have been created in their image. That is to say, able to become conscious of the Infinite, and also one day able to
create people in our own image in return.</p>
<p>In relation to human society, our life is equally very important, because we are the result of a long list of survivors who have escaped the epidemics and wars which have made us the offspring of a long natural selection. We owe it to ourselves to participate actively in the plan that will allow humanity to reach the Golden Age, which it greatly deserves and which it is about to enter. We are the cells of this huge being that is Humanity, and at the time of the birth of this humanity, each cell, each one of us is very important, in that he or she has a role to play.</p>
<p>Finally, in relation to our own self, our life has only the importance that we give it. If we recognize the Elohim as our creators, and if we wish to contribute to the diffusion of the messages, so that they will be known all over the Earth so that mankind enters the Golden Age, and if we enjoy our participation in this gigantic endeavor, then we are enjoying life for that reason.</p>
<p>The question was, 'what is the purpose of life?' Life was made to be enjoyed, whether you find pleasure in the diffusion of the messages of our creators, or pleasure in contributing to the entry of Humanity into the Golden Age, or pleasure in pleasing yourself by putting yourself in tune with the Infinite, or by any other means.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-pleasure"><a class="header" href="#what-is-pleasure">What is Pleasure?</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>What is pleasure?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>Pleasure is the reaction of an organism which has accomplished an act producing pleasant chemical reactions.</p>
<p>A baby experiences pleasure while suckling its mother's breast because its hunger is appeased, and because the chemical reaction produced by the milk on the papilla of the tongue produces a pleasant sensation. All our senses are there to give us pleasure, and <em>Sensual Meditation</em> is based on an improvement of the perception of pleasure provoked by the chemical reactions transmitted by our senses.</p>
<p>Everything we do during our life, we do because it gives us pleasure. There is not one action performed during our entire life which is not done for pleasure. The person who pays his income tax does it because it pleases him not to have to go to jail for not having paid it. The woman who throws herself under the wheels of a car to save her child, does it because it pleases her to see her child survive, even if it means being wounded in the process. And the soldier who throws himself under enemy fire in order to save his battalion, does so because it pleases him to die for his comrades. The suicide pilots of Japan are the ultimate example of this type of heroism -- pleasure.</p>
<p>There is a difference between direct pleasures, such as immediate sensual satisfaction, and indirect pleasures, such as the choice of behavior, which we spoke of earlier, and which are a reaction to exterior interventions without resulting in a conscious development of
our means of perception of the environment.</p>
<p>It is only when conscious pleasure is obtained in solitude in an attempt to improve the quality of one's perception, that true blossoming can take place. We are linked to the Infinite through our senses. Someone who cannot see, hear, smell, touch, or taste, would actually be dead, even if his heart was still beating. He would not be conscious of his environment and would therefore possess no intelligence.</p>
<p>It is important to note that those who are deprived of one sense develop the remaining senses to a much greater extent than people with all their senses. Blind people, for example, develop an acute sense of hearing that we cannot grasp, or can read with their finger-tips.</p>
<p>Scientific experiments have demonstrated that the pleasure centre is located within the brain. This was discovered by placing electrodes in that part of the brain and sending small electrical discharges. The people who were experimented on felt something which was close to an orgasm, the satisfaction of having made a new discovery and the feeling of being honorably quoted in public all in one go. It was then proven by complementary measures that it was this same pleasure centre which was activated, when one was reaching sexual orgasm, or when discovering something, or when an artist had finished a masterpiece, or when a soldier received a medal.</p>
<p>Better still, another experiment demonstrated that artists who were sexually aroused while creating noticed an increase in their potential of creativity.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more logical. Pleasure increases the potential of creativity, because it stimulates all our senses, and a creator must be linked to Infinity in order to have a harmonious masterpiece born.</p>
<p>We must then strive towards improving the quality of our perception of pleasure by increasing the sensitivity of all our senses.</p>
<p>As a direct result, other than the increased enjoyment, this increase in sensitivity will develop our total potential of creativity so that the rest of humanity may benefit from our creations, thus improving the general level of consciousness.</p>
<p>This is what is being taught at the courses of awakening that we organize for the Raelians.</p>
<p>By improving the level of individual consciousness, we improve the level of consciousness of Humanity, and so increase the chances of entering the Golden Age.</p>
<p>In order to change society, we must first change the individuals of which it is composed. Violence is always produced by those who are
unhappy.</p>
<p>By improving the individual's happiness, we help to lessen the potential for violence. Moreover and quite often, violence is produced by individuals who believe that they are unhappy, and the art of politicians is to strengthen this belief so as to overthrow those in power, to take their place. Then the former use the same tactics to reach the same goals, thus maintaining a feeling of dissatisfaction, which could one day, through the amplification of successive overthrows, result in the general feeling that the cause of the dissatisfaction is in another country. This is how wars are started.</p>
<p>If each individual becomes conscious of the Infinite, by developing his own sensuality, then the whole of society will be transformed.</p>
<p>This will start by the awakening of the consciousness of people more developed than others, who once they have attained a certain level, will become Guides for the people around them, and will allow others to become fully awakened, who will in turn awaken others, and so on. Thus gradually, the level of consciousness of Humanity will be raised to such a point that a fatal world conflict would become impossible.</p>
<p>The process has already started, and thousands of small, non-violent manifestations have taken place around the world, organized by students or intellectuals in favor of peace, of unilateral disarmament of such-or-such a country, and it is amplified by television, the central
nervous system of Humanity.</p>
<p>Each individual contributes at each moment of his life to the awakening or the stifling of planetary consciousness. You must not be afraid to influence others, as we are here for that purpose. But we should direct all our efforts and every word that we say, at every moment, so that all we say and every action we do has a positive influence on the course of human history.</p>
<p>One must never seek to convince others, because people who perceive that we are trying to convince them, have a tendency to strengthen their position. Whereas, if one discovers a point in common with the other's philosophy, then one can concentrate on this common point, and from there, unveil a new path for our listener, so that he will have the impression of having found it out by himself.</p>
<p>It is foolish to say that we will not influence anyone else by stubbornly following our own way and letting others follow theirs.</p>
<p>The mere fact of not trying to influence others influences them even more than if one takes a fanatical stand on something. People fear fanaticism more and more, whatever the subject, and they are right to do so. This is in fact the beginning of wisdom.</p>
<p>On Earth, there are people who seek the truth and show it, and others who seek the truth and hide it, but there is not one single person who does not seek it. Then there are people who pretend that they have found the truth and show it, too often concerned with maintaining traditions, and last there are people who have found the real truth and show it: the Raelians.</p>
<p>We are very interested in those people who seek the truth and show it, because it shows that they are sincere and open-minded, generally very intelligent and relatively harmonious. In any case, for the most part, they are ready to accept a new vision of the world without fearing that this change will traumatize them to the point of unbalancing them. These people represent a great majority of present-day Raelians; they are the pioneers.</p>
<p>Those people who seek the truth and hide it, are also very important to us, but they will be more than likely to join us when they have overcome their self-consciousness, and no longer worry what other people think of them.</p>
<p>Those people who pretend that they have found the truth, and show it, will come to us when it becomes evident that nothing is constant in the universe, and therefore it is nonsense to try to preserve traditions that no longer mean anything. They just love their traditions but could not care less about what &quot;God&quot; really is.</p>
<p>All of these people do this for pleasure. The latter get pleasure in thinking that their children will pray in exactly the same way as they have, and that their children will teach their own children the very same ways of praying, even though school will teach them that man is descended from the monkey. So what if it is wrong? What is important to them is for the teaching at school to be respected, yet also for what the priest says to be respected. The fact that they are both contradictory is neither here nor there, what is important is that they are both traditions, and according to these lovers of tradition, it is not up to us to question which one is right.</p>
<p>Christians would surely crucify Jesus a second time if he himself were to ask them not to go to church on Sunday, or not to baptize their children before they had reached adulthood. This is the position adopted by the worshippers of tradition.</p>
<p>Those people who seek the truth and hide it, feel pleasure in thinking that what people think they are is more important than what they truly are. Those people would not crucify Jesus, they would even be against it, but they would still not intervene or even say anything. They do not want to get involved in anything, not even if it means defending what they believe to be the truth.</p>
<p>When all of Humanity enjoys its sensuality to the full, the risk of a world conflict will have disappeared. At the root of all violence, there are always sensually dissatisfied people. This is why we must learn to enjoy all of our senses, and help everyone around us to discover their total sensuality, starting with children. It is not sufficient to show them &quot;how it works&quot;, like sexual education tends to do, but we must teach them &quot;how to use it&quot; so as to obtain and give more pleasure.</p>
<p>Sexual education should be replaced by sensual education.</p>
<p>Pleasure is always fulfilling, direct pleasure that is, and not the pleasure of the soldier who dies for his comrades. Direct pleasure develops in each individual the means to become in tune with the Infinite, and really feel a part of the Infinite.</p>
<p>Our body is nothing more than an accumulation of atoms organized according to a master plan, the genetic code, which interacts with the environment through an infinity of chemical reactions of which we are not always aware. Raising our level of consciousness corresponds to feeling an even greater number of these chemical reactions, so as to better situate ourselves in the Infinite, and so as to become more harmonious. When we feel linked to the universe, eternal and Infinite, we can never be unhappy, because we have then discovered the pleasure of being.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-death"><a class="header" href="#what-is-death">What is Death?</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>What is death?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>Death in relation to the Infinite means nothing. The matter of which we are composed is eternal. Therefore, we are made of eternity.</p>
<p>The infinitely small particles which compose our nose existed before they became part of us. Some of these particles were contained in the steak that our mother ate while we were in the womb, and those particles passed through her body and became part of our face. Other particles were in the fruit that we ate yesterday, they came into our abdomen and then travelled through our bloodstream to land on our nose. This is true for every part of our body. After death, the reaction will be exactly the same. The particles will return to the Earth to be recycled, and some particles will land in animals, others in plants, but most of them will remain in the Earth 'for you are dust and you will return to dust.'</p>
<p>Death, however, is the final cataclysm for the mass formed by this accumulation of organized matter, which makes up what we are.</p>
<p>Death is the beginning of the process of dispersion of the matter of which we are composed.</p>
<p>But to understand death, one must truly understand what life is all about. Life is nothing other than the organization of the unorganized.</p>
<p>The Elohim came on Earth at a time when life did not exist. There existed only unorganized matter at our level - what we call the biological level.</p>
<p>They took this matter, they &quot;kneaded&quot; it, as stated in <em>The Bible,</em> and they &quot;shaped&quot; it to create living beings. This was all done at the molecular level, but for primitive man, this was impossible to understand, so they related it to pottery. They believed that the creators took a little piece of clay and created Man like you would do a flower pot. It is true that the creators did take chemical components from the Earth, but they combined them scientifically in such a way that the inanimate became animated.</p>
<p>Every living thing on Earth has been created by the Elohim, starting from a basic &quot;brick&quot;, a molecular structure composed of atoms judiciously assembled. Our scientists are starting to discover that all living things, animal or vegetable, man or beast, have similar basic components. It's like a sort of alphabet, where every letter is an atom which makes up the genetic code of each living species. The order in which the letters are placed may differ with each species, but the letters of the alphabet would always remain the same. So with one relatively simple &quot;brick&quot;, our creators were able to make an enormous quantity of &quot;houses&quot; that differed in their appearance, but which were all identical in their basic components. When the species reproduce, they are doing no more than &quot;reproducing&quot; the genetic code of the first model of their species.</p>
<p>So then, life is the organization of the unorganized, and death is disorganization of the organized.</p>
<p>Life is like a house that would build itself, by itself, starting from its own plan, and furthermore, it would maintain itself automatically.</p>
<p>Death is the end of this automatic maintenance and the beginning of the dispersion of the basic materials of which the house is made, finally ending in the destruction of the plan which it had contained.</p>
<p>The Great Architects of our universe who have designed the plans of these &quot;houses&quot; designed a type which would be capable one day of matching its creators and becoming architects themselves, by creating other plans able to build &quot;houses&quot; which build themselves, by themselves. This type of superior &quot;house&quot; is Man, who will soon be able to create new synthetic genetic codes, new plans, starting from inanimate matter.</p>
<p>The living being was created with the ability of situating himself in his own environment through his &quot;perception feelers&quot;, his senses.</p>
<p>Humans are nothing more than self-programming, self- reproducing biological computers.</p>
<p>There is no difference between humans and highly sophisticated biological computers, such as those we are now able to produce, only our computers are far more perfected and can perform far more accurately than a human.</p>
<p>The computers can be equipped with means enabling them to situate themselves in their own environment. Recently, a computer was equipped with wheels enabling it to move by itself around obstacles, thanks to TV cameras wired to its &quot;brain&quot;. It can &quot;see&quot; exactly as we can with our eyes, and it can move in its environment.</p>
<p>A computer only does what it has been programmed for, and so does Man; but let us continue our comparison between Man and the computer.</p>
<p>As far as hearing is concerned, it is easy to endow a computer with a microphone that will pick up noise as we do with our ears.</p>
<p>It is also possible to give it an analyzer, which will identify the perfumes that surround it, just as we do with our nose.</p>
<p>Then it is also possible to give it a taste analyzer that would indicate the taste of various substances as we do with our mouth.</p>
<p>Finally, it is possible to equip the computer with feelers capable of functions that we perform with our hands, such as measuring temperature, hardness and weight.</p>
<p>Better still, the computer can be equipped with &quot;organs&quot; infinitely superior to our human organs. Let us take sight, for example. The cameras used on the computer can be equipped with multiple lenses, including a zoom lens, which will enable it to see clearly what is going on many kilometers away, or a microscopic object; things that the human eye is unable to see unless equipped with artificial prostheses such as binoculars or microscopes.</p>
<p>The same thing applies to the sense of hearing. While we can only perceive the sounds that exist around us in a very narrow range, certain animals, like dogs, can perceive a wider range. So our computer can be equipped with receptors sensitive to ultra-sounds or infra-sounds and directional microphones allowing it to hear sounds that are many kilometers away at a precise location.</p>
<p>Getting back to sight, the cameras could be equipped to pick up ultraviolet or infrared rays enabling it to see at night, something we are not capable of doing with our limited vision.</p>
<p>And as for the sense of smell, the odor analyzer could identify odors and instantly transmit the chemical composition of the perfumes or surrounding gases, something which our nose could never do.</p>
<p>For the sense of taste, we could also equip it with flavor analyzers capable of making a detailed chemical analysis of any given substance.</p>
<p>Finally, for the sense of touch, we could give it feelers, a touch mechanism able to analyze with precision the temperature, the weight and the hardness of objects or substances, other than saying it's hot or it's heavy. It would also be able to manipulate things at temperatures that our skin could not endure, things weighing a thousand times more than our poor human muscles could lift.</p>
<p>We could go even further and equip our computer with senses that man does not possess or that he is unable to make use of. We could, for example, give it radar, permitting it to move in complete darkness, a sonar, an x-ray detector, a compass, a gravity detector, a radio communication system, so many senses that our body is not provided with, and that we cannot even perceive, except with the use of electronic prosthesis that we can rarely have altogether in the same place and at any given time.</p>
<p>Let us compare the energy requirements of the human computer and the machine. When a man needs energy, he says, 'I am hungry', looks for food and eats it. Scientists have recently completed a computer equipped with electrical batteries. It works, and its cameras enable it to move and to store and move about heavy boxes just like a fork-lift truck. Suddenly, the battery charge becomes too weak, and it loses its efficiency. Its energy indicator shows that the time has come to charge the batteries. Then, by itself, it will move to an electrical outlet, plug itself in, and wait patiently until the charge is sufficient, then disconnect itself and return to work. This is no different from the man who says 'I am hungry' and proceeds to the cafeteria to get food at mealtimes and then returns to work.</p>
<p>What happens when a man is injured? He stops working, he gets medical attention, then returns to work. A computer can be programmed for self-maintenance, just as it was programmed to feed itself. If one of its parts becomes defective, it will go to a workshop, remove the part and replace it with a new one, and this is done without human help. This computer will then become eternal and will never be faced, as man is, with the issue of death.</p>
<p>Man is able to reproduce himself, and so is the computer. It only needs to be programmed accordingly. If a computer is programmed to make replicas of itself, which have the ability to do the very same thing, then in a very short time, we will have an overgrowing population of computers. This is why they must not be programmed to reproduce; for humans, this is called the species conservation instinct, the unconscious desire to reproduce. Humans find pleasure in copulating, unaware that they are in fact responding to an impulse, the species conservation instinct. If there was no pleasure in copulating, then there would be no reproduction. The human genetic code was programmed so that pleasure is obtained through copulation, in order for reproduction to take place. The humans who use a contraceptive method, such as the pill, the cap or the condom, etc., make a fantastic &quot;nose-thumbing&quot; to their genetic code. They consciously take pleasure without it leading to reproduction. Pleasure always brings an expansion of the mind, but overpopulation is certainly a serious danger for Humanity; contraception is a magnificent way that humans have of showing that they are conscious of themselves and conscious of the importance of their actions in regard to the whole of humanity.</p>
<p>Let us get back to our computer; it could also be programmed to feel pleasure in doing certain things. Every computer which performs as it has been programmed to perform, experiences pleasure from its performance. When the computer &quot;feels&quot; that its energy level is low, it says, 'this is wrong', then runs over to recharge. When it feels the new energy running through its circuits, it can say 'this is good' and in
doing so 'feels pleasure'.</p>
<p>What goes into the program of a computer? Information contained in a memory bank that will rule the behavior of the computer. If it is programmed to calculate, it will calculate; if it is programmed to draw, it will draw; if is programmed to play music, it will play music.</p>
<p>But it will not play music if it has been programmed to calculate and vice versa, unless of course it has been programmed for both functions.</p>
<p>How is a human programmed? On the one hand, there is the genetic code, which is filled with information related to his behavior, to his sensual means, which enable him to communicate with his environment, to his physical means so that he can move, feed himself, reproduce, etc. This is what each human receives at birth (more or less in relation to his heredity), and which constitutes the innate. On the other hand, his education will provide him with a language so that he can communicate with his fellow humans, laws which will regulate his behavior, a set of &quot;moral values&quot;, a teaching, a concept of the world, a religion, etc. All these things will determine the individual's behavior. The individual will be under the impression that he is performing on his own, of living in a world where his values are those which he has chosen, but they will be only those which his education has imposed upon him, those ideas received from people who have played the role of educator or programmer. This is called experience.</p>
<p>Ordinary people, unconscious people, are incapable of doing anything other than that which they have been programmed for by their genetics or by their experience, by their heredity and by their educators. The &quot;total man&quot;, the man who raises his level of consciousness so as to situate himself in the infinity of space and time, becomes a self-programmable computer. He can question the program which has been imposed on him by his education without asking advice, and replace his total or partial education with a new and more appropriate set of values that will seem better, in relation to higher standards, than those antiquated ones which had motivated his family and his environment. Those standards were aimed generally at conditioning him to keep alive the traditions of the past, of times when men were totally primitive, with a low level of consciousness in their conception of the world, and the role that humans had been created to play in it.</p>
<p>An ordinary man who wishes to become a &quot;total man&quot;, a man with a higher level of consciousness which would enable him to exploit a little more than 10 per cent of his brain -- percentage used by ordinary men and partial men -- must be able to do his own in-depth &quot;brain-washing&quot;. This operation will enable him to look at everything in his brain, to put back what seems to be good and to disregard what seems to be bad. He will keep his own ideas and get rid of the ones he received either from other people, his family, or his environment, ideas which he has received from those people who wanted to model him after their own conventions and for their own convenience. This applies to his behavior, his reactions to world events, the way he awakens, gets up, gets dressed, works, speaks to others and listens to them, the blossoming of his sexual life, etc. - everything, each gesture, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem. A total man is conscious of each movement of his eyebrows and the effect it could have on the people surrounding him.</p>
<p>Quite obviously, this great &quot;spring cleaning&quot; in order to be efficient, must be done in the company of someone who has already crossed the line which separates &quot;ordinary men&quot; from the infinite universe of &quot;total man&quot;, someone who knows all the different paths, and who is able to lead this new traveller in the proper direction, and to guide without forcing him, letting him choose his own path freely.</p>
<p>A man's consciousness is a house which has been built usually by other people, based on standards which have never been questioned, since the same thing had been done to them and to their parents before them. The total man will destroy this house and build a new one, adapted to his taste, and to his imagination. He will recover from the old ruins certain things which seem reusable, and combining them with the new components, he will build a new house, perfectly suitable to his new personality. Men have houses built in conformity to their level of consciousness. Houses have always been square or rectangular, with slanted roof tops, and nothing could change that. They keep building the same type of house over and over again. Every house is like a Greek temple with vertical walls, like pillars, and a slanted rooftop, like a pyramid sitting on top of the Greek pillars. Modern construction techniques allow for more personalization when building a house. For instance, it could be completely round, it could have the shape of a ball, or an egg, or an Egyptian pyramid, or a bird, or a tree, etc. Houses which are built in series all looking exactly the same and forming morbid looking uniform villages, are the exact reflection of the level of consciousness of their inhabitants. And yet paradoxically, the house is a typical example of Man's capacity for self-programming. The blackbird has always built his nest in the same way, and it cannot change that because this is programmed into its genetic code. Man, however, is capable of adapting his shelter to his environment. He can build Greek temples, pyramids, huts, igloos, wooden cottages, skyscrapers made of iron and cement, cathedrals made of stone, and towers made of metal or glass.</p>
<p>The mere fact that Man is a self-programming computer does not make him different from the machine. All computers can be programmed to do the same as we do, and like us, they could be programmed to reproduce themselves. It could be also possible to program a computer so that it could be self-programming. It would be able to live, to work, to reproduce itself from a basic program, based on its experiences, and to give this information to its descendants, to the computers that it would reproduce.</p>
<p>We could even imagine a &quot;mind expanding&quot; computer which would have the ability to awaken the programs of already existing computers which had been created as non self-programming, so that this feature would be transmitted to them...</p>
<p>Man is therefore starting to discover, through the machine, that there is nothing mysterious about himself nor his origins, nor his behavior. Everything that a man can do, a computer can do, and what is more, it can do it much better. This applies to everything that can be done by a human, and it includes artistic creativity. There are computers capable of composing music, of drawing and so on.</p>
<p>We could never find a human ability that cannot be programmed in a computer, even getting in tune with the Infinite could be programmed. All of this is simply fantastic, and Man is able to look upon himself as a wonderful machine and concentrate whole-heartedly on seeking happiness and total blossoming through the fulfillment of his own needs and that of his fellow men, in order to build a world in which all men will be happy to feel that they are infinite and eternal.</p>
<h2 id="sexual-freedom-and-no-obligation"><a class="header" href="#sexual-freedom-and-no-obligation">Sexual Freedom and No Obligation</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>The message mentioned total sexual freedom. But for a couple who read the books and wish to become Raelians, does it become mandatory to practice the exchange of partners?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>Freedom to do something and obligation are two different things, which must not be confused. A Raelian couple who love each other deeply, where both partners do not wish to share a sexual experience with other couples, should stay together. If they feel happy being with each other without the need to experience anything else, that is just fine. Everyone must do as he or she pleases. Sexual freedom of choosing a single partner, once you have discovered who you really are, and once you have discovered a partner who fills your every need and whose every need you seem to fill, becomes a question of choice to live together. However, quite often an experience with another person will render you more appreciative of your partner's company, as you become more conscious of his or her qualities. In so far as sexual contacts are concerned, everything is possible, everything is permitted. I must insist on the word permitted for it does not mean mandatory.</p>
<p>Since the creation of the Raelian Movement, I have had the opportunity to see many couples start new relationships. Some of these seem to be so successful that I can very well see what they hope to gain in seeing other partners. Perhaps these experiences would only confirm that they are truly made for each other. Some people are sufficiently awakened to understand that the experience in itself is not really necessary. When a man is totally conscious, he does not need to do something to find out what the result is going to be, he knows it, he can feel it, unless the experience is aimed at the awakening of a disciple, or it is felt essential to his own personal progression. Each person is free to follow his own chosen path so long as the following three fundamental rules are observed:</p>
<p>Respect the tastes and decisions of others in the free choice of their partners; be permanently conscious that others do not belong to us and that nobody can be the owner of anybody; and always seek above anything else, the happiness of those we claim to love.</p>
<p>On this basis, everything is possible, couples, threesomes, foursomes and &quot;more-somes&quot; of Raelians living a perfect happiness, whether they be homosexuals, heterosexuals, or bisexuals.</p>
<h2 id="raelism-and-homosexuality"><a class="header" href="#raelism-and-homosexuality">Raelism and Homosexuality</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>What is the position of the Raelian Movement on homosexuality?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>It is quite simple: each individual has the right to do with his or her body as he or she sees fit. Homosexuality is not a normal or abnormal mode of behavior. Each person must live an harmonious sexual life corresponding to tastes and natural tendencies. In the mother's womb the sexual differentiation is felt at a very late stage of development. There are very masculine men, and men who are more feminine, just as there are women who are virile and others who are very feminine, with all the possible and imaginable shades in between.</p>
<p>It is foolish to condemn a homosexual because he is a homosexual, just as it would be foolish to condemn a man because he is a man, or a cat because it is a cat, as all of this is genetic. Many types of animals are homosexual, and in the country one can see frequently, dogs, cattle, and chickens indulging in homosexual behavior.</p>
<p>Homosexuality is as natural as a dog or a hen is natural.</p>
<p>What is not natural is the wish to obligate others to have the same sexuality as oneself. It is generally what those who torture people who do not resemble them are doing. They are generally the same as those who are racist, traditionalist and militarist.</p>
<p>The aggression aimed at homosexual people is a form of racism. It usually comes from people who lead a miserable sex life, and cannot tolerate that others could blossom while living something else.</p>
<p>These same people who condemn homosexuality will forgive very easily a man charged with raping a woman, even though it is an abominable crime. Among the Raelian Guides there are male and female homosexuals, there are heterosexuals and bisexuals. All of them are blossoming because they are conscious of being loved as they are with the opportunity to fulfill themselves living in their body as they please, in a fraternal communion of thought that no other religion is able to give them. How can one still be a Roman Catholic follower when one hears the &quot;Vatican Usurper&quot; condemn homosexuality while depriving women of their rights of becoming priests. These are two proofs of racism and sexism that can help those who have eyes to see the truth.</p>
<h2 id="deists-and-evolutionists-the-false-prophets"><a class="header" href="#deists-and-evolutionists-the-false-prophets">Deists and Evolutionists: The False Prophets</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>It is written, 'When the age of the Apocalypse will arrive, there will be many false prophets.' Who are they?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>There are many false prophets in our day and age. Do not forget the meaning of the word <em>prophet</em>, its etymology. It means &quot;the one who reveals&quot;, as we have stated earlier. The false prophets of our time, that is to say, those who reveal or teach false information, are all those people who try to bring humanity back to primitive beliefs in an immaterial and impalpable, yet almighty &quot;God&quot; who watches over each human being to either punish or reward him, as the case may be.</p>
<p>It is a concept which mixes the infinite, which is indeed impalpable in its totality because of it being infinite in space and eternal in
time - yet without any consciousness of its own and thus with no power over humanity as a whole, nor over any single person, for that matter -- and the Elohim who are our creators, who are real and almighty in this sector of the infinite, but who love us, their children, and who allow us to evolve freely in our scientific and spiritual progression.</p>
<p>The second category of contemporary false prophets are all those people, scientists or not, who claim that life on Earth, and therefore Humanity, is the result of successive random chance events, which all happened during what they call &quot;evolution&quot;. As Einstein said, there cannot be a watch without a watchmaker. All those people who believe that we came from the monkey through a slow evolutionary process, believe that the beautiful watch which we are, has built itself by accident. It is a bit like saying that if we put all the components of a watch together in a bag and shook it around for a while, we would eventually get a perfect working watch. Try a billion times if you so desire...</p>
<p>The evolutionists are also false prophets, false informers, people who lead the majority of the population away from the truth about our creators, the Elohim. This population, which easily swallows and dumbly believes in everything said by these narrow-minded high priests in white coats - who compose the majority of the scientific community - is purposely kept ignorant and so inevitably believes that which officialdom says is true. Can you begin to imagine what the Elohim feel when they see that humans attribute their masterpiece to random chance?</p>
<h2 id="suicide"><a class="header" href="#suicide">Suicide</a></h2>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>It is said in the second message that one who suffers too much pain has the right to commit suicide. Does it mean that suicide is a good thing?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>We will all be judged according to our actions while living on this Earth. The person with more positive than negative actions will be entitled to eternal life on the planet of the Elohim. If a person suffers too much physically, and if human science is unable to relieve his pain, then he has a right to put an end to his life. If most of his actions in his life were positive, he will be re-created to live eternally.</p>
<p>If they were mainly negative, he will not be re-created, and for him there will be nothing. However, if most of his actions were negative, he could be re-created to be judged later by those same people whom he made to suffer.</p>
<p>Someone who is not physically suffering, or who has no handicap, must not commit suicide, as we all have a mission to accomplish on this Earth, especially Raelians. They must dedicate their lives to the diffusion of the messages given by the Elohim, of whom they are the spokes-people. To end one's life is like an act of treason, it's like running from one's post during combat. I am referring to the combat which will awaken humanity and allow it to survive in order to reach the Golden Age. The Elohim are counting on each one of us, and each Raelian is very precious to our creators.</p>
<p>Allow me to repeat myself: the only time when suicide is acceptable is when a person is in extreme physical pain, which cannot be relieved by science, or when his faculties have diminished to the point where he can no longer act effectively.</p>
<p>All other people are messengers of our Fathers who are in the sky, and we must all dedicate our lives to the spreading of the good news.</p>
